Chapters trace the history of the language from its obscure beginnings over 1500 years ago as a collection of dialects spoken by marauding, illiterate tribes. They show how the geographical spread of the language in its increasing diversity has made English into an international language of unprecedented range and variety. The authors examine the present state of English as a global language and the problems, pressures and uncertainties of its future, online and offline. They argue that, in spite of the amazing variety and plurality of English, it remains a single language. Jan Svartvik is Emeritus Professor at the University of Lund, Sweden. He is co-author of A Communicative Grammar of English(with Geoffrey Leech) and A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language (with Randolph Quirk, Sidney Greenbaum and Geoffrey Leech). He has published on other varied aspects of English linguistics, such as corpus linguistics, forensic linguistics, contrastive grammar and nautical terminology. He is a Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, The Royal Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities and Academia Europaea.

In the abstract interaction between the two grammars, the Matrix language is more activated than the Embedded language, resulting in either monolingual Igbo discourse or discourse with an Igbo morphosyntactic frame but with English insertions. Using both linguistic and quantitative analyses, this book uniquely investigates the governing principles and restrictions on bilingual clauses and grammatical codeswitching in the context of a West African language and English.

Many post-colonial varieties of English, which are mostly spoken as a second language in countries such as India, Nigeria and the Philippines, are thought to have a syllable-timed rhythm, whereas first language varieties such as British English are characterized as being stress-timed. While previous studies mostly relied on a single acoustic correlate of speech rhythm, usually duration, the author proposes a multidimensional approach to the production of speech rhythm that takes into account various acoustic correlates. The results reveal that the two varieties differ with regard to a number of dimensions, such as duration, sonority, intensity, loudness, pitch, and glottal stop insertion. The second part of the study addresses the question whether the difference in speech rhythm between Indian and British English is perceptually relevant, based on intelligibility and dialect discrimination experiments. The results reveal that speakers generally find the rhythm of their own variety more intelligible, and that listeners can identify which variety a speaker is using on the basis of differences in speech rhythm.", "description": "1 online resource (xvii, 226 pages) : illustrations (some color).", "docType": "Book, Computer File", "edition_format": "Print book : Document ", "summary": "\r\n   This book addresses the question whether Educated Indian English is more syllable-timed than British English from two standpoints: production and perception.

When the couple, newly married, relocates to Francophone Geneva, Collins-- fearful of one day becoming 'a Borat of a mother' who doesn't understand her own kids-- decides to answer her questions for herself by learning French. When in French is a laugh-out-loud funny and surprising memoir about the lengths we go to for love, as well as an exploration across culture and history into how we learn languages-- and what they say about who we are. Collins grapples with the complexities of the French language, enduring excruciating role-playing games with her classmates at a Swiss language school and accidentally telling her mother-in-law that she's given birth to a coffee machine. In learning French, Collins must wrestle with the very nature of French identity and society-- which, it turns out, is a far cry from life back home in North Carolina. Plumbing the mysterious depths of humanity's many forms of language, Collins describes with great style and wicked humor the frustrations, embarrassments, surprises, and, finally, joys of learning-- and living in-- French\"--", "description": "243 pages ; 25 cm", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : Biography : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"A language barrier is no match for love.

Around the year 900, an Old English version was produced by an anonymous writer, possibly encouraged or inspired by King Alfred. The translator actively transformed Orosius's narrative: cutting extraneous detail, adding explanations and dramatic speeches, and supplying a long section on the geography of the Germanic world.

Part 2 gives practical suggestions on how to help your students improve their presentation skills. In Part 3 you will learn how to teach academic skills using nonacademic examples. Parts 1-3 are thus useful for anyone involved in teaching academic English, whether they have used the other books in the series or not. Part 4 suggests two syllabuses for teaching writing and presenting skills, based on the two core books: English for Writing Research Papers English for Presentations at International Conferences This book will help you i) understand the world of your students (i.e. academic research), ii) plan courses, and iii) exploit the What's the Buzz? sections in the books on Writing, Presentations, Correspondence and Interacting on Campus.

The contributors are eminent researchers from the fields of philosophy of language, theoretical linguistics, and communication theory, who answer questions on this important issue. This exciting area of controversy has until now mostly been treated from the viewpoint of philosophy. This volume adds the views from semantics, conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. Authors address matters such as the issue of semantic minimalism vs. radical contextualism, the attribution of responsibility for the modes of presentation associated with Noun Phrases, and how to distinguish the indirect reporter\u2113\u0301\u2113s responsibility from the original speaker\u2113\u0301\u2113s responsibility.

Clearly indirect reporting has some bearing on the semantics/pragmatics debate, however, there is much controversy on \u2113\u0301\u2113what is said\u2113\u0301\u2113, whether this is a minimal semantic logical form (enriched by saturating pronominals) or a much richer and fully contextualized logical form. This issue will be discussed from several angles. Many of the authors are contextualists and the discussion brings out the need to take context into account when one deals with indirect reports, both the context of the original utterance and the context of the report. It is interesting to see how rich cues and clues can radically transform the reported message, assigning illocutionary force, and how they can be mobilized to distinguish several voices in the utterance. Decoupling the voice of the reporting speaker from that of the reported speaker on the basis of rich contextual clues is an important issue that pragmatic theory has to tackle.

This guide is part of the English for Academic Research series. Part 1 of the book sheds light on the world of academia, the writing of research papers, and the role of journal editors and reviewers. Part 2 gives practical suggestions on how to help your students improve their presentation skills. In Part 3 you will learn how to teach academic skills using nonacademic examples. Parts 1-3 are thus useful for anyone involved in teaching academic English, whether they have used the other books in the series or not. Part 4 suggests two syllabuses for teaching writing and presenting skills, based on the two core books: English for Writing Research Papers English for Presentations at International Conferences This book will help you i) understand the world of your students (i.e. academic research), ii) plan courses, and iii) exploit the What's the Buzz? sections in the books on Writing, Presentations, Correspondence and Interacting on Campus. Adrian Wallwork has written over 30 books covering General English (Cambridge University Press, Scholastic), Business English (Oxford University Press), and Scientific English (Springer).

The author has conducted extensive fieldwork in Pakistan and the UK to study migration between the two countries.

Tracing access to literacy in this way also shines a light on the literacy mediators migrants turn to for help with English language learning and when trying to access the bureaucratic literacies of migration. The study ends by exploring how migrants use all of their language resources, not just English, to fit into their new homes once they have arrived in the UK.

Authors and scribes were raised in an intellectual and didactic tradition in which the acquisition and development of encyclopaedic knowledge was highly valued. Their concern with the elementary aspects of time, language, world history, God's creation and the Bible informed their activities as compilers of manuscripts or as producers of texts. They reaped the fruits of the learning that had grown over the centuries, digested them, or discarded them, or caused them to re-emerge after a long period of time and be used for purposes quite different from those for which they had originally been cultivated. The varieties of such fruit are as diverse as encyclopaedic learning itself, involving musicology, epistolography, liturgy, the study of grammar, codicology, the establishment of reading programmes, the writing of history and, perhaps most prominently, the compilation and promulgation of glosses and glossaries - one of the most essential disciplines in early medieval learning. The present volume casts light on the way in which encyclopaedic knowledge came to fruition in the ever expanding and diversifying world of medieval learning. Resulting from the fourth workshop in the 'Storehouses of Wholesome Learning' project, it builds on the foundations laid by its predecessors. The contributors discuss the influence of encyclopaedic knowledge in their respective fields of expertise. Their generous responses have provided a rich palette of new insights into medieval intellectual culture. Their articles deepen our understanding of medieval learning in its ability to instrumentalise the knowledge inherited from the classical world in the creation of new cultures of wisdom.", "description": "409 pages : illustrations (some color) ; 24 cm.", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : Conference publication : English", "summary": "\r\n   Encyclopaedic knowledge - factual knowledge of the divine and human worlds - had profound effects on intellectual activities in the early Middle Ages and its aftermath.

Ovid's Amores, written in the first century BC, is arguably the best-known and most popular collection in this tradition. Born in 43 BC, Ovid was educated in Rome in preparation for a career in public services before finding his calling as a poet. He may have begun writing his Amores as early as 25 BC. Although influenced by poets such as Catullus, Ovid demonstrates a much greater awareness of the funny side of love than any of his predecessors. The Amores is a collection of romantic poems centered on the poet's own complicated love life: he is involved with a woman, Corinna, who is sometimes unobtainable, sometimes compliant, and often difficult and domineering. Whether as a literary trope, or perhaps merely as a human response to the problems of love in the real world, the principal focus of these poems is the poet himself, and his failures, foolishness, and delusions. By the time he was in his forties, Ovid was Rome's most important living poet; his Metamorphoses, a kaleidoscopic epic poem about love and hatred among the gods and mortals, is one of the most admired and influential books of all time. In AD 8, Ovid was exiled by Augustus to Romania, for reasons that remain obscure. He died there in AD 17. The Amores were originally published in five books, but reissued around 1 AD in their current three-book form. This edition of the first book of the collection contains the complete Latin text of Book 1, along with commentary, notes and full vocabulary. Both entertaining and thought-provoking, this book will provide an invaluable aid to students of Latin and general readers alike.

In order to integrate early medieval Britain into the wider scholarly research into the history of emotions (a major theme in other fields and a key field in interdisciplinary studies), this volume brings together established scholars, who have already made significant contributions to the study of Anglo-Saxon mental and emotional life, with younger scholars. The volume presents a tight focus a \" on emotion (rather than psychological life more generally), on Anglo-Saxon England and on language and literature a \" with contrasting approaches that will open up debate. The volume considers a range of methodologies and theoretical perspectives, examines the interplay of emotion and textuality, explores how emotion is conveyed through gesture, interrogates emotions in religious devotional literature, and considers the place of emotion in heroic culture. Each chapter asks questions about what is culturally distinctive about emotion in Anglo-Saxon England and what interpretative moves have to be made to read emotion in Old English texts, as well as considering how ideas about and representations of emotion might relate to lived experience. Taken together the essays in this collection indicate the current state of the field and preview important work to come. By exploring methodologies and materials for the study of Anglo-Saxon emotions, particularly focusing on Old English language and literature, it will both stimulate further study within the discipline and make a distinctive contribution to the wider interdisciplinary conversation about emotions.", "description": "viii, 308 pages ; 24 cm.", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   Research into the emotions is beginning to gain momentum in Anglo-Saxon studies.

Many of these are not addressed in the IELTS test papers. Smith et al (2005) report a large number of complaints of clinical malpractice that are related to weak communication skills of international nurses. If these complaints were justified, they would call into question the current English language requirements for these nurses. To register for practice in the UK, international nurses must first acquire a minimum of 7.0 IELTS in all skill areas. This paper reports on a project that investigated the extent to which existing IELTS English language requirements for internationally qualified nurses are appropriate and adequate for the contexts in which these nurses hope to work. The approach was qualitative, with data gathered from interviews and focus groups. A rich picture of nursesa\u0302 daily communication emerged from the study. Nurses have to engage in a wide array of communicative activities, involving all four language skills, for a range of functions that are central to successful healthcare. The overall findings of the research are that the IELTS test assesses certain aspects, predominantly in relation to listening, of English language use that are criterial for successful communication in nursing. However, in all four skills, there are many competencies required to achieve IELTS Band 7 that are, at most, marginally relevant to assessing whether overseas-trained nurses have the requisite English competence to practise in the UK.

But the truth is different and a lot less scary, as John McWhorter shows in this delightful and eye-opening exploration of how English has always been in motion and continues to evolve today. Drawing examples from everyday life and employing a generous helping of humor, he shows that these shifts are a natural process common to all languages, and that we should embrace and appreciate these changes, not condemn them.

Did you know that silly once meant \"blessed?\" Or that ought was the original past tense of owe? Or that the suffix -ly in adverbs is actually a remnant of the word like? And have you ever wondered why some people from New Orleans sound as if they come from Brooklyn?
