Consequently they find that they do not understand the language it is written in and are constantly faced with vocabulary that is at the same time familiar yet has taken on a different meaning. Much research has been conducted into the problems with the ambiguities between Mathematical English and Ordinary English at the school level, but this study is an investigation into the ambiguities in language encountered by students who have returned to studies after several years in the work force. Do their added years of experience make their reading of mathematical text easier or harder? How much teacher input is still necessary? Can they learn the mathematics from the textbook alone? It is in an attempt to seek answers to these questions that this study was undertaken.", "description": "ii, 113 leaves ; 29 cm", "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript : Microfiche ", "summary": "\r\n   The readability of their mathematics textbook is of prime importance to the College or University level students.

According to the National Assessment on Educational Performance, 64% of tested fourth grade students with disabilities do not have basic reading skills; for economically disadvantaged students the rate is even higher at 78%. This qualitative study used in-depth interviews and classroom observations to examine two urban Title 1 schools whose third and fourth grade students with disabilities have demonstrated success on the English Language Arts portion of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS). Sixteen teachers of second, third, and fourth grade inclusion and special education classes were asked what instructional strategies they believed contributed to the success of their students with disabilities on the standard MCAS. Also, at each school, current and former principals were asked what they thought contributed to these students' success on the test. Results are presented using a theoretical framework based on the instructional recommendations of the National Reading Panel (2002) and Joseph Torgesen (1998). The major findings were that teachers who did teach phonics to their students with disabilities used explicit and systematic phonics programs. To teach vocabulary, they used explicit and implicit instructional strategies, and their strategies for reading fluency ranged from frequent practice to reading plays. To promote reading comprehension they used highly analytical and reflective questions and graphic organizers. One school principal believed that her school's success was due to an extraordinary special education resource teacher and to focusing on the core curriculum.", "description": "176 leaves ; 29 cm", "docType": "Book, Archival Material", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   Across the nation, many students with disabilities do not have basic reading skills.

Chambers instead discusses the philosophy of gardening and landscaping that developed during this period, the gardeners who made the gardens, and the new planting materials available to them. Between 1650 and 1750, new developments in botanical horticulture led to the availability of a vast new repertory of trees and shrubs. These imports, mainly from America, were the materials that made the extensive English landscape garden possible. Inspired by texts of Virgil, Pliny, and Horace as well as by scientific advances of the newly founded Royal Society, theorists and designers, owner-planters, and countless gardeners and nurserymen used the expanded vocabulary of botanical taxonomy to create gardens that transformed the look of the English landscape. Chambers illustrates how philosophy and practice, ancient ideals and horticultural experimentation all served one end: the creation of an ideal landscape that was both Edenic and classical. Out of this came not only the foundation collection for the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew but an English landscape of forest garden, ferme ornee, and park landscape that would have been inconceivable a century earlier: the English landscape that we know today. -- Publisher.", "description": "214 p. : ill.

Is this because the foundations of Tolkien's imagined world were inspired by very real places? Was there a real shire in the English countryside that inspired the Shire of Middle Earth? What influences shaped the darker and more troubled lands beyond its borders? How did European languages fuse in Tolkien's creative genius to create a vocabulary that evokes extraordinary places and heroic adventures?

He is undoubtedly of great historical importance, but the ultimate justification for the present gathering of work is that Jennings was a wonderful filmmaker who made uniquely beautiful films. Contained within this one man was a seemingly impossible array of artistic abilities. He had a poet's command of film language, a painter's eye for evocative imagery and composition, a musician's ear for rhythm and tone and counterpoint, a Soviet's sense of juxtaposition, a journalist's nose for the concrete and the factual, and a compassionate man's love for the people he portrayed. It may seem paradoxical that an artist of such positively romantic parts should have labored almost exclusively in the documentary realm, with all that it implies of subordination to subject and sponsor. But Jennings' particular talents emerged at a time of very particular need, and that seeming subordination to a cause is in fact the key to the continuing resonance of his work. In the incongruous coupling of the Cambridge aesthete and the British propaganda machine, both parties turned out to be anxious to compromise for the sake of the union. In these pictures, Jennings' impressive aesthetic arsenal helped to expand the scope and the vocabulary of documentary. In turn, the documentary idea, especially in time of war, served to focus and direct his aesthetic impulses to public ends. The result was a short, shining, perfect marriage.

Spotlight on small groups gives viewers an in-depth look at two reading groups led by master teacher and author Debbie Diller. Debbie leads the groups through a structured routine (introduction, guided practice, conferring, check-in, and more practice), demonstrating how to balance whole-group and differentiated instruction and showing how visual aids such as strategy bookmarks pique student interest. One group in the video focuses on vocabulary development and works with a nonfiction title; the other group shows how to teach the strategy of inferring with a fiction title.

Using models for describing behaviours allows replacing part of the coding activities with higher-level definitions of concepts and behaviour: commonly cited as reducing costs, errors and time-to-market, while improving software quality and communication between stakeholders. However, we continue to see spectacular failures of large, expensive IT projects, often blamed on badly specified requirements. With high-level models of business environments-independent of technical considerations-now possible and standards like the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) emphasising business and domain experts as the owners of their business requirements, we are reaching the point where formal modelling of requirements by the business experts themselves is necessary. However, requirements specifications written in natural language (e.g. English) still play a fundamental role in communicating the requirements. This thesis investigates an approach to semi-automatically transforming natural language specifications written by business/domain experts into formal models.

Some of the most vexing natural-language problems that are addressed in this book entail recognizing and processing idiomatic expressions, understanding metaphors, matching an anaphor correctly with its antecedent, performing word-sense disambiguation, and handling out-of-vocabulary words and phrases. This fourteen-chapter anthology consists of contributions from industry scientists and from academicians working at major universities in North America and Europe. They include researchers who have played a central role in DARPA-funded programs and developers who craft real-world solutions for corporations. These contributing authors analyze the role of natural language technology in the global marketplace; they explore the need for natural language mapping-tools that can cull important data from the vast array of social-media postings; they describe innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and applications; and they offer NLP tools for physicians, educators, and translators. Their contributions constitute diverse and multifaceted solutions for the knotty natural-language problems that permeate everyday human communications.

Long overdue and with a focus on the needs of English language learners (ELLs) within the classroom, Instructional Assessment of English Language Learners is a unique book designed to teach readers the basic concepts of assessing English. Today's education courses place an increasing emphasis on the regular classroom teacher to instruct and assess English language learners. Yet, classroom teachers have few resources available to them in regard to assessing ELLs within their classrooms. This book helps readers master the assessments to be administered to English learners and cover a range of literacy skills deemed necessary for English language acquisition and reproduction, while also assessing the student's literacy skills in their primary language. The overarching goal of this book is to enable teachers to acquire a deep understanding of the value of instructional assessment for ELLs and the importance of evaluating the results to provide the students with immediate, appropriate and meaningful instruction. The book addresses the specific areas of language arts related to the development, acquisition, and reproduction of the English language: oral language development and vocabulary; concepts of print and the alphabetic strategies; word recognition and word identification strategies; reading fluency; reading comprehension; written language development and spelling; content area literacy; procedural knowledge; and problem-solving strategies. The strategies presented in this text are research-based and are known to increase reading comprehension for ELLs. ...

Additionally, this research sought to identify if performances on vocabulary measures are related to performances on comprehension measures. Further, the study examined if the use of the PWIM impacts vocabulary and/or comprehension scores. Finally, this research focused on the possibility of the influence oflanguage status on vocabulary and comprehension skills. The experimental group of 14 second graders participated in the 4-week intervention, while the control group, consisting of 21 students from the other second grade classes, received typical classroom instruction without the intervention. Nine of the experimental group participants and 16 of the control group participants speak English as a second language. To assess students' vocabulary knowledge, a researcher-generated assessment was administered prior to intervention (pretest) and immediately following intervention (post test). This assessment targeted some of the vocabulary expected to be suggested by students in the course of the project. Also, the Scholastic Reading Inventory was used to test comprehension. The PWIM intervention was analyzed through parametric statistics by examining the vocabulary gains that participants made from the pre-assessment to the post-assessment. Results indicated that statistically significant differences were not achieved between the control and experimental group participants on the final assessment. Within the experimental group, statistically significant differences in vocabulary scores and comprehension scores were noted. Results also indicated that students' vocabulary gain scores and comprehension gain scores did not differ significantly based on language proficiency.", "description": "ix, 54 leaves : digital, PDF file", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   [Author abstract] The main purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine if students' vocabulary acquisition is enhanced with the picture word inductive model (PWIM), a researchbased method of vocabulary instruction (Calhoun, 1999).

The Spectrum of speech recognition applications ranges from understanding simple commands to getting all the information in the speech signal such as words, meaning and emotional state of the user. Because it is very hard to constrain a speaker when expressing a voice-based request, speech recognition systems have to be able to handle (by filtering out) out of vocabulary words in the users speech utterance, and only extract the necessary information (keywords) related to the application to deal correctly with the user query. In this thesis, we investigate an approach that can be deployed in keyword spotting systems. We propose a confidence measure feedback module that provides confidence values to be compared against existing Automatic Speech Recognizer word confidences. The feedback module mainly consists of a soft computing tool-based system using fuzzy Gaussian mixture models to identify all English phonemes. Testing has been carried out on the JULIUS system and the preliminary results show that our feedback module outperforms JULIUS confidence measures for both the correct spotted words and the falsely mapped ones. The results obtained could be refined even further using other type of confidence measure and the whole system could be used for a Natural Language Understanding based module for speech understanding applications.", "description": "viii, 58 pages : illustrations (chiefly color)", "docType": "Book, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : Microfiche ", "summary": "\r\n   The increasing need for more natural human machine interfaces has generated intensive research work directed toward designing and implementing natural speech enabled systems.

A fundamental benefit of the standard is its ability to transform extremely difficult printed circuit board testing problems that could only be attacked with ad-hoc testing methods into well-structured problems that software can easily deal with. IEEE standards, when embraced by practicing engineers, are living entities that grow and change quickly. The Boundary-Scan Handbook, Second Edition: Analog and Digital is intended to describe these standards in simple English rather than the strict and pedantic legalese encountered in the standards. The 1149.1 standard is now over eight years old and has a large infrastructure of support in the electronics industry. Today, the majority of custom ICs and programmable devices contain 1149.1. New applications for the 1149.1 protocol have been introduced, most notably the I\u0300n-System Configuration' (ISC) capability for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The Boundary-Scan Handbook, Second Edition: Analog and Digital updates the information about IEEE Std. 1149.1, including the 1993 supplement that added new silicon functionality and the 1994 supplement that formalized the BSDL language definition. In addition, the new second edition presents completely new information about the newly approved 1149.4 standard often termed A\u0300nalog Boundary-Scan'. Along with this is a discussion of Analog Metrology needed to make use of 1149.1.

The authors describe the most important language features for the development of a speech recognition system. This is then presented through the analysis of errors in the system and the development of language models and their inclusion in speech recognition systems, which specifically address the errors that are relevant for targeted applications. The error analysis is done with regard to morphological characteristics of the word in the recognized sentences. The book is oriented towards speech recognition with large vocabularies and continuous and even spontaneous speech. Today such applications work with a rather small number of languages compared to the number of spoken languages.

In 2010, the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) reported that 34% of recent Nevada high school graduates required developmental coursework prior to enrollment in college-level classes, with approximately half of these students requiring remediation in English. Yet, little is known about the language skills these students possess. May enrollment in developmental English be an indicator of underlying language deficits? The first purpose of this study was to determine the associations between multiple measures of oral language, oral vocabulary, written language, working memory, and cognition in a sample of university students enrolled in the three English course sequences offered at the University of Nevada, Reno. The second purpose of the study was to determine which standardized and/or researcher-developed measures were able to differentiate among students in each of the three course sequences. Participants were comprised of 19 adolescents between the ages of 18 to 20 years at UNR. Students were recruited from the following Core Writing courses: English (ENG) 098, ENG 100I, and ENG 102. Most students had completed their initial Core Writing course in Fall of 2011. They were given an assessment battery measuring the following language-related skills: non-verbal IQ, reading fluency and comprehension, oral vocabulary knowledge, oral and written expression, and working memory. Positive associations were found among many of the language and literacy measures. The strongest associations were found among the expressive language and literacy measures. Participants' performance on the Formulated Sentences subtest of the CELF-4, the Written Expression Scale of the OWLS, and the Oral Reading Fluency subtest of the WRMT-III were the three measures that served to differentiate between students in the three course sequences. Whereas there were no differences in performance on this measure between students enrolled in the two developmental course sequences, students enrolled in the standard freshman curriculum performed significantly better than their peers. The practical implications of these results are discussed.", "description": "1 microfilm reel (vi, 71 leaves) : illustrations ; 35 mm", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Microfilm : English", "summary": "\r\n   With the high rate of college enrollment, students can be expected to bring with them a wide range of academic skills.

A Specialized Course for Students and Professionals has been created in response to this new trend. An international team of both health sciences specialists and language specialists has collaborated on a collection of materials which seeks to address the new needs. The collection consists of a student coursebook, an instructor's manual, a learner's dictionary and an online learning environment. Texts representative of the major fields of Public Health have been collated and developed for didactic purposes, covering Epidemiology, Environmental Health, Health Promotion, Health Policy, Health Economics, Management, Health Ethics and Law, and Research.The Learner's Dictionary is a first attempt to develop a comprehensive, interdisciplinary aid to vocabulary learning for Public Health teachers and students across Europe. It has been developed through a unique combination of Public Health specialists and language teachers working together to define and translate a wide range of Public Health terms which are sufficiently accurate to assist professional development whilst at the same time presented in a way that will enhance language acquisition.

As a result, the classic's basic vocabulary takes on new meaning. War is any situation that demands hard choices about creation and destruction, life or death. The state is the system in which we live - our household, our culture or society, or our own mind. Defense ensures the integrity of our boundaries and allows life to flourish within them.

This dictionary is your gateway to discover the meaning of the words in the Greek New Testament, even if you don't know the first thing about the Greek language. Part one contains defintions or cross-references for more than 8,000 English terms, definitions that are based on the meaning of the more than 5,000 Greek words in the Greek New Testament. But, unlike some other tools, where you have to know the Greek alphabet or must first look up a Strong's number before you get to the real meaning of things, this dictionary is organized alphabetically by the words in your English New Testament. It covers all the common English words and all the names of people and places found in the New Testament, and often lists the Scripture references where that word is used. The primary entries also list the Greek words and Strong's numbers so that you have them as a reference to other works, but no knowledge of Greek is needed to make full use of this dictionary. Part two is a simple lexicon of the Greek New Testament words, organized by Strong's numbers, defined by terms found in part one, so that when you want to dig deeper you can look up the other English word entries in part one where that Greek word is mentioned. So now you are looking closer at the dictionary, wondering which English translation it is based on, trying to decide just how it will fit into your Bible study. That is the best part; this dictionary is based not on the English words of any one translation, but on the total vocabulary of seven different English translations: J.N. Darby's version, the King James version, the New King James Version\u00ae, the New American Standard Bible\u00ae, the New International Version\u00ae (1984 edition), the New International Version\u00ae (2011 edition), and the English Standard Version\u00ae. And the Scripture \"quotations\" found in the work are actually the author's paraphrased text so that no one English version is favored over another. Multifunctional but easy to use, comprehensive but focused on one English word at a time, AMG's Comprehensive Dictionary of New Testament Words is the perfect tool for studying the English New Testament in the version of your choice.", "description": "xiii, 1327 pages : maps ; 24 cm", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   AMG Publishers, a premier provider of Christian books and Bibles that help the average person understand the Bible in its original languages is proud to present to you the multi-functional reference tool that is AMG's Comprehensive Dictionary of New Testament Words.

Numerous outbursts of violence fall within Cavarero's category of horrorism, especially when the phenomenology of violence is considered from the perspective of the victim rather than that of the warrior. Cavarero locates horrorism in the philosophical, political, literary, and artistic representations of defenseless and vulnerable victims. She considers both terror and horror on the battlefields of the Iliad, in the decapitation of Medusa, and in the murder of Medea's children. In the modern arena, she forges a link between horror, extermination, and massacre, especially the Nazi death camps, and revisits the work of Primo Levi, Hannah Arendt's thesis on totalitarianism, and Arendt's debate with Georges Bataille on the estheticization of violence and cruelty.\" \"In applying the horroristic paradigm to the current phenomena of suicide bombers, torturers, and hypertechnological warfare, Cavarero integrates Susan Sontag's views on photography and the eroticization of horror, as well as ideas on violence and the state advanced by Thomas Hobbes and Carl Schmitt. Through her searing analysis, Caverero proves that violence against the helpless claims a specific vocabulary, one that has been known for millennia, and not just to the Western tradition.
