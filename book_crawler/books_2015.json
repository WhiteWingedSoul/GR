Frank Cioffi argues that proper form undergirds effective communication and ultimately even makes society work more smoothly, while nonstandard English often marginalizes or stigmatizes a writer. He emphasizes the evolving nature of English usage and debunks some cherished but flawed grammar precepts. Is it acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition? It is. Can you start a sentence with a conjunction? You can. OK to split an infinitive? No problem. A grammar and usage handbook like no other, One Day in the Life of the English Language features accessible chapters divided into 'Fundamentals, ' 'Fine Tuning, ' and 'Deep Focus, ' allowing readers to select a level most suited to their needs.

It will be particularly useful to those wishing to produce well-designed materials for teaching initial literacy via phonics, for teaching English as a foreign or second language, and for teacher training. English spelling is notoriously complicated and difficult to learn; it is correctly described as much less regular and predictable than any other alphabetic orthography. However, there is more regularity in the English spelling system than is generally appreciated. This book provides, for the first time, a thorough account of the whole complex system. It does so by describing how phonemes relate to graphemes and vice versa. It enables searches for particular words, so that one can easily find, not the meanings or pronunciations of words, but the other words with which those with unusual phoneme-grapheme/grapheme-phoneme correspondences keep company. Other unique features of this book include teacher-friendly lists of correspondences and various regularities not described by previous authorities, for example the strong tendency for the letter-name vowel phonemes (the names of the letters <a, e, i, o, u>) to be spelt with those single letters in non-final syllables.\"--Publisher's website.", "description": "1 online resource (xxx, 492 pages)", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"This book will tell all you need to know about British English spelling.

Along the way, she investigates colorful historical characters on both sides of the grammar debate in her efforts to unmask the origins of contemporary speech.

No matter which languages you know, if you want your work seen, studied, and cited, you need to publish in English. But that hasn't always been the case. Though there was a time when Latin dominated the field, for centuries science has been a polyglot enterprise, conducted in a number of languages whose importance waxed and waned over time-until the rise of English in the twentieth century. So how did we get from there to here? How did French, German, Latin, Russian, and even Esperanto give way to English? And what can we reconstruct of the experience of doing science in the polyglot past? With Scientific Babel, Michael D. Gordin resurrects that lost world, in part through an ingenious mechanism: the pages of his highly readable narrative account teem with footnotes-not offering background information, but presenting quoted material in its original language. The result is stunning: as we read about the rise and fall of languages, driven by politics, war, economics, and institutions, we actually see it happen in the ever-changing web of multilingual examples. The history of science, and of English as its dominant language, comes to life, and brings with it a new understanding not only of the frictions generated by a scientific community that spoke in many often mutually unintelligible voices, but also of the possibilities of the polyglot, and the losses that the dominance of English entails.

To meet these challenges, ELLs need immediate feedback about how the development of their language abilities interacts with their academic performance; and teachers need practical strategies to help ELLs develop the specific content and language abilities necessary for success. In Formative Language Assessment for English Learners, the research team of Rita MacDonald, Timothy Boals, Mariana Castro, H. Gary Cook, Todd Lundberg, and Paula A. White demonstrates what good language assessment for formative purposes is, explains the cycle of formative language assessment, and shows how it unfolds stage by stage in a school setting. Based on a five-year collaborative project with middle and high school teachers in three major school districts, the book presents a process for: Weaving a language focus into content lessons. Analyzing students' language from writing samples to help them broaden their linguistic choices. Creating active partnerships with students as they learn and practice new ways to use English. When classrooms are defined by effective language assessment for formative purposes, they become dynamic spaces in which teachers can use that information to plan clear, attainable steps to increase student learning, and students develop deeper understandings of both academic content and academic language. Formative Language Assessment for English Learners provides practical strategies to implement a unique process for formative assessment that can truly change classroom practice.", "description": "xxiii, 88 pages ; 24 cm", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   The significant challenges faced by English Language Learners (ELLs) become greater during the middle and high school years, when they must learn more abstract academic concepts with emergent English language skills and differing levels of background knowledge.

Linking Bourdieu's theory of the linguistic market and his practice-based perspective with recent advances in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology, this book offers a fresh new critique of global English. The authors highlight the material, discursive, and semiotic processes through which the value of English in the linguistic market is constructed, and suggest possible policy interventions that may be adopted to address the problems of global English.

No-one has the right to tell artists to paint in a particular way, nor the right to tell composers to compose in a particular way. So don't we have a right to talk and write as we please? In the same breath, pedants bemoan what they believe to be falling standards in schools, and in writing in general, and then deride those who cannot write as well as themselves, calling them \"appallingly ignorant\". Rather than belittling those who, through no fault of their own, had a seemingly impoverished education, surely a decent response would be one of understanding and sympathy. But perhaps it is the pedants who are appallingly ignorant for failing to see that language cannot be correct or incorrect, right or wrong. As this book proves, to call, say, a split infinitive wrong is about as silly as calling a lampshade dishonest. It is what philosophers call a category mistake. Contrary to what pedants think, English is not going to the dogs. Change is not necessarily for the worse. If it was, English speakers would have lost the ability to communicate centuries ago. Instead English has gone on to become the lingua franca of the world. We need a different, more tolerant, attitude to language, one that respects the innate creativity and lust for novelty that defines Homo sapiens. And one that eradicates the anxiety that many suffer when they have to put pen to paper or give a talk.

Drawing on the British Academic Written English corpus - a large corpus of proficient undergraduate student writing collected in the UK in the early 2000s - this study explores Chinese students written assignments in English in a range of university disciplines, contrasting these with assignments from British students. The study is supplemented by questionnaire and interview datasets with discipline lecturers, writing tutors and students, and provides a comprehensive picture of the Chinese student writer today. Theoretically framed through work within academic literacies and lexical priming, the author seeks to explore what we know about Chinese students writing and to extend these findings to undergraduate writing more generally. In a globalized educational environment, it is important for educators to understand differences in writing styles across the student body, and to move from the widespread deficit model of student writing towards a descriptive model which embraces different ways of achieving success.

The craze for learning spoken English has led to the growth of various coaching institutes all over the country. Much as they may profess and advertise, it is not really possible to learn any language in 30 or 40 days. A person who genuinely wants to learn the language needs to spend at least two to three hours every day for at least five or six months before he or she feels confident to communicate in English. The prime objective of this book is to encourage the students to learn English as a tool of communication and to enable them to understand the language thoroughly. The book basically looks at the language from the learners' point of view and guides them through co-operative learning methods in order to master the effective communication skills in English. The book has been divided into four convenient units of Grammar, Pronunciation, Conversation and Vocabulary. Each chapter covers one main area of learning English - explained thoroughly with examples and special attention being given to the basic skills. Carefully selected and balanced practical exercises have also been designed and included with each topic or chapter to give the readers or learners, particularly the students, ample practice and a complete understanding of the subject. In short, the book follows the modern functional approach to the study of English. So readers, the book is definitely a one-stop solution for learning English!", "description": "1 online resource", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   In today's competitive world, Spoken English is considered as a passport for a guaranteed success in life.

In these crucial years, new teachers establish their identities, learn the ins and outs of the curriculum, acclimate to unfamiliar communities, and cope with student behaviors that they never expected. All of this can be daunting for novice teachers. This book can help. The stories within are written by English teachers in the early stages of their careers. In their carefully crafted narratives, teachers offer practical strategies, professional insights, and a wealth of tips for surviving the first years in the classroom. The narratives are grouped into thematic chapters with brief introductions of key terms, helpful learning activities, and provocative discussion questions, all intended to foster critical conversation about beginning a career teaching English. In a time when many teachers leave the profession too soon, Early Career English Teachers in Action gives voice to those who have decided to stay. More importantly, this book validates teacher narratives as a powerful way of understanding what happens inside of the classroom-- a way that provides more authentic evidence of learning than standardized test scores will ever supply.\"--", "description": "xvi, 191 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"The first few years of teaching are critical to the professional development of effective English teachers.

The use of body part-related expressions is both interesting and fun. This book contains about 2,000 such idioms, words, and expressions, such as \"with the back against the wall,\" \"brainstorming,\" \"sweet tooth,\" and \"tongue in cheek.\" Says author Per-Olof Hasselgren, \"As a surgeon, I understand the importance of anatomy and the knowledge of organs and tissues. This book reflects my longstanding interest in idioms and other expressions referring to body parts, and it 'connects' anatomy with the spoken and written language.\" This book was written for three main reasons. First, anatomy matters, particularly in surgery. During the last several years, collecting such expressions became a hobby for the author. Second, as someone moving to this country from another part of the world, Dr. Hasselgren is interested in the peculiarities of the American language. Idioms, slang, and other expressions are specific for any given language and quite often cannot be directly translated. Third, when one starts to be aware of them, written and spoken body language can become quite entertaining. Per-Olof Hasselgren, M.D., Ph.D., is the George H.A. Clowes Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School in Boston. He is director of endocrine surgery and vice chairman of research in the Department of Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School. He received his initial medical and surgical training in Sweden, and has been a practicing surgeon in the U.S. for more than thirty years. Dr. Hasselgren has also conducted NIH-supported research for almost thirty years, resulting in multiple scientific publications. Dr. Hasselgren resides with his wife in Boston.

With this, the volume also includes a variety of frameworks and approaches, synchronic and diachronic. Most European Germanic languages share some central linguistic features, such as V2, gender and agreement in the nominal system, and verb inflection.

Why the combination of humans and cows probably led to capitalism--its name from Latin for head, as in heads of cows. Why holy cow and sacred cow have almost opposite meanings. Whether people actually chewed the fat or ate crow (and why it's a crowbar). How a hog became a motorcycle and a chick a young woman. What happens to freeze the balls off a brass monkey. What buck has to do with being naked. Why the birds and the bees. Why a piggy bank and why one feeds the kitty. What lame ducks have to do with U.S. presidents. How red herring came about via activists opposed to fox hunting. Where snake oil, popular in the 1800s and rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, came from. That the proverbial fly in the ointment goes back to the Bible's Ecclesiastes (10:1). How Swiss watchmakers created teensy-weensy coaches for fleas to pull in flea circuses. And much--much!--more.

In imitating song's forms and sound textures through lyric's rhythm, rhyme, and repetition, these poets were pursuing song's \"thought\" in a double sense. They not only asked readers to think of particular kinds of song as musical sound in social performance (ballads, national airs, political songs, plainchant) but also invited readers to think like song: to listen to the sounds of a poem as it moves minds in a different way from philosophy or science.

{"genre_form": null, "publisher": "Edinburgh : JonesCat Publishing, 2015.", "name": "Happer's grammar boot camp", "author": "Richard Happer", "abstract": "You can write beautiful English. I guarantee it. That or which? Where does the apostrophe go? What is an infinitive, and why do people get so wound up about splitting it? Oh man, not another grammar know-it-all banging on about petty rules that are only designed to trip me up and make him feel clever and that don't matter anyway and- Woah, dragon! Even the experts don't agree on everything. But there are very widely accepted standards on most elements of writing, including how to write clear business English. On the one hand, it's good that we have these accepted ways of writing well. They can help you express yourself perfectly. That can be useful. Many employers use CVs with spelling mistakes as paper aeroplanes. These employers want to create a company that values quality. They know their customers care about details. So they want employees who can make a good impression and focus on the details. Because then they'll make lots of cash. On the other hand, many of these rules are bonkers. They hinder clear and graceful writing. The best writers have been ignoring them for centuries. For example, the whole split infinitives brouhaha grew from the notion that English should emulate Latin. That's a crackpot idea! And why should the original meaning of a word be the only correct one? Sometimes, on closer examination, what many people assume is a never-to-be-broken rule is actually a question of style. It's not: are you right or are you wrong? It's: do you want to write informally or formally? Sadly, to some people even the bonkers rules are traps. If you don't spot them then they will pounce and tear you apart. Yeah, I hate those people too. I call them the Grammar Trappers. But if you spend a little time learning the tricks, then using them becomes second nature. 'Mirror, Signal, Manoeuvre' sounded baffling at first, but you don't even think about it when you get in the car now. It's like the old sign at the swimming pool: 'No running, no bombing, no petting ... ' If you follow those few simple guidelines, then the lifeguard won't throw you out. You can dive in and have some fun. It's the same thing with grammar. Get the rules in your head (or at your fingertips in a handy wee eBook) and the pool of language is yours. You can even do some petting if you know which corners to hide in ... In my Grammar Boot Camp I run you through 31 of the most common grammar topics in written English. This book is short, but it covers 99 per cent of the Wobbles that Pooh and the rest of us have when writing. I give straightforward explanations and just enough technical stuff to help it all make sense. My examples are simple and clear. Occasionally I try to be amusing (forgive me). You can spend five minutes each day reading a tip and one month later you'll have the confidence to master any sentence. They are wrong. So wrong. This little guide tells you exactly how. So you can beat the Grammar Trapper know-it-alls at their own game. Why listen to me? I have been a professional writer for 18 years. As a copywriter I have created advertising for brands you see every day. My finely crafted phrases have enticed you to buy stuff you probably didn't need: whisky, Guinness, Pot Noodles, personal loans. Sorry about that. But I also write nice things like books about space, novels and children's fiction. This book began life as a series of daily emails that I sent round to all the staff of an advertising agency I worked in. People loved it. They requested more tips, added examples and, sometimes, corrected me. So I know for a fact that this course works. You really will get something out of it. Even if you remember one solitary tip you'll feel a little bit more confident when you next sit down to write. And if you remember a lot of things, then you'll feel positively empowered.

A study of syntactic and information-structural factors.", "author": "Gea Dreschler", "abstract": "During the fourteenth and fifteenth century, the English language went through two quite remarkable changes: it lost the verb-second (V2) system that is characteristic of many Germanic languages, and it saw the introduction of three cross-linguistically rare passive. This thesis asks whether these two developments are connected, not just because they take place around the same time, but more importantly, because the passive and V2 perform similar information-structural functions in the language. Using this case study, it aims to shed light on the interaction between syntax and information structure. 0The studies in this thesis show that the loss of V2 has larger consequences than just a change in the order of subject and finite verb. After the loss of V2, English gradually becomes a predominantly subject-initial language and the presubject position becomes mostly reserved for contrastive or focused material. It is argued that this new organization of the initial positions in the clause and the importance of the subject as an unmarked theme leads to an increase in 'subject strategies', i.e. means to put an argument in subject position: passives, middles and a range of non-agentive subjects. The loss of V2 also means a reduction of the options for rearranging arguments to achieve a given-before-new order of information, an important cross-linguistic function. The passive remains as one of the few options to achieve this effect and it is argued that this is the reason for the increase in the use of the passive in English after the loss of V2.", "description": "432 pages.", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   During the fourteenth and fifteenth century, the English language went through two quite remarkable changes: it lost the verb-second (V2) system that is characteristic of many Germanic languages, and it saw the introduction of three cross-linguistically rare passive.

Words Like Daggers explores the scolding invectives, malevolent curses, and ecstatic prophesies of early modern women as attested to in legal documents, letters, self-narratives, popular pamphlets, ballads, and dramas of the era. Examining the framing and performance of violent female speech between the 1590s and the 1660s, Kirilka Stavreva dismantles the myth of the silent and obedient women who allegedly populated early modern England. Blending gender theory with detailed historical analysis, Words Like Daggers asserts the power of women's language--the power to subvert binaries and destabilize social hierarchies, particularly those of gender, in the early modern era. In the process Stavreva reconstructs the speech acts of individual contentious women, such as the scold Janet Dalton, the witch Alice Samuel, and the Quaker Elizabeth Stirredge. Because the dramatic potential of women's powerful rhetorical performances was recognized not only by victims and witnesses of individual violent speech acts but also by theater professionals, Stavreva also focuses on how the stage, arguably the most influential cultural institution of the Renaissance era, orchestrated and aestheticized women's fighting words and, in so doing, showcased and augmented their cultural significance. \"--", "description": "1 online resource.", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : State or province government publication : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"Dramatic and documentary narratives about aggressive and garrulous women often cast such women as reckless and ultimately unsuccessful usurpers of cultural authority.

Have they almost given up on writing? Do they reach for the tissue box when you say, \"Write an essay\"? Do you worry they won't be ready for high school or college writing? Do they say they think of things to write but can't write them down? This 2ND EDITION includes proofreading marks and exercises, a new chapter on common grammar mistakes, and numbered lessons to easily keep track of daily lessons. This course teaches your teens what they need to know for high school and will be prepare them for college writing: persuasion, compare-and-contrast essays, literary analysis, a research paper with MLA documentation, and much more. In addition, students will learn how to write description and narration essays. Beginning writers will feel safe, and advanced writers will enjoy Digging Deeper lessons. Written by the same author who wrote JUMP IN, Apologia's popular middle school writing curriculum, this course is the natural next step for those who value college-preparatory material presented in incremental steps with a conversational tone. Sharon Watson has the knack of teaching students with no prior writing experience in the same class with advanced writers. She knows when to introduce new material and how to keep it interesting. Both reluctant and eager writers will benefit from the way she reveals exactly how the \"magic trick\" of writing is done! With over 100 daily lessons and complete instructions for 22 essays and reports, this is an engaging course students will enjoy--or not dread. And, more good news: the course is written to the student and almost teaches itself. Really. Because writers come in all varieties, this course begins with basic writing skills so that inexperienced writers can catch up quickly on fundamentals, and then it smoothly merges them with their age-mates. More advanced writers will enjoy the Digging Deeper lessons designed specifically for them. New and seasoned writers will gain a confidence that comes from success.

Ensuring that students have sufficient language proficiency for full-time study at an English medium university is a problem that institutions in English-speaking countries struggle with, due to high enrolments of international students. The aim of the study was to determine whether the cut-off scores established for various levels of English language support and writing courses are appropriate and fair, by examining student achievement data (course outcomes, grades and scores and GPA), as well as the perceptions of stakeholders towards individual studentsa\u0302 placement. Consistent with studies on the predictive validity of IELTS, the current study found few large or meaningful correlations between IELTS scores and academic success. However, some significant correlations were found between IELTS reading and writing scores and academic success. There was some variation in studentsa\u0302 perceptions towards IELTS and their placement within English and writing courses, as there was in the knowledge of the test among faculty members, but both sets of stakeholders seemed generally positive towards the use of the test and the established cut-off scores. The use of IELTS for admission and the established cut-off scores seem justified by analysis of student data and stakeholder perceptions. However, more investigation is needed to determine its appropriateness as a tool for placing students in English language and writing courses.

Speech samples of 80 test-takers performing the IELTS long-turn speaking task were rated by eight accredited IELTS examiners for numerous discrete measures shown to relate to the comprehensibility construct, including segmental, prosodic, fluency, and lexicogrammatical measures. These variables, rated on separate semantic-differential scales, were included as predictors in two discriminant analyses, with Cambridge English pre-rated IELTS overall speaking scores and scores on the Pronunciation subscale used as the grouping variables. Statistical outcomes were then triangulated with the IELTS examinersa\u0302 focus group data on their use of the IELTS Pronunciation scale levels and the criteria most relevant to their scoring decisions. Results suggest the need for greater precision in the terminology used in the IELTS Pronunciation subscale to foster more consistent interpretation among raters. In particular, descriptors that were solely distinguished from adjacent bands by stating that the test-taker has achieved all pronunciation features of the lower band but not all those specified in the higher band had poor prediction value and were cumbersome for examiners to use, revealing the need for specific pronunciation features to be delineated at those levels of the scale.

It is a simple, easy to use textbook for both the motivated student and teacher alike. It is useful for beginners with no knowledge of Arabic and for those who have had about a semester or two of either dialect or MSA. It is particularly helpful for people who are going to travel to the Levant for the first time or those who have lived there for a while and need to master and reinforce what they have learned. The book is designed for foreign students who have little or no knowledge of Arabic, formal or informal. It can be used by students themselves on their own, or with the help of an instructor or a tutor. Basically every word is introduced in three forms: Arabic form, transliteration form and English meaning. A beginner non-native who only desires to speak and communicate orally can rely on transliteration and English, while a more experienced student, a heritage student or a non-native with a year of exposure to Arabic who can read and has learned some basic survival vocabulary, may also benefit from the Arabic script and the grammatical notes available in the book. Even if you are well versed in MSA, you still need to have this book. You may already be able to read the newspaper headlines or listen to the news and read a street sign, but it will sound very awkward to use MSA when you meet and greet someone, need a taxi, ask for directions, bargain and negotiate, open a bank account, order a meal or a sandwich, chat with someone in the street or in a cafe\u0301, enter a supermarket or a store, ask for the time, or make an appointment and get to know someone on a personal or even professional level, etc.\" --", "description": "245 pages : illustrations ; 28 cm.", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"This book is a basic, direct and self-guided handbook to learn Levantine dialect.
