A growing number of language minority students face extended time in EL programs past the typical 4-7 years of language acquisition; however, multivariate data use in reclassification decisions has rarely been investigated as a factor. Using mixed methods, this study describes the variation of reclassification outcomes by different combinations of data (composite and aggregate decision rules) and describes the use of data by decision makers in EL programs. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine variation in reclassification eligibility according to six composite and two aggregate decision rules applied to performance data of EL students in grades 2-11 (n=667), including high-performing EL students (n=107), EL students with disabilities (n=78), and high-performing EL students with disabilities (n=8). Findings illustrate the wide variation in reclassification eligibility for all groups, and the broad range of abilities in students not reclassified. Interviews with district decision makers (n=16) and analyses of district documents illuminated variety in data use. Interviews also illustrated influences and constraints on noticing, interpretation, and constructing implications of data, especially for EL students at the intermediate level. Taken together, findings suggest that certain district-chosen rules can dramatically reduce reclassification eligibility, and yet the long-term EL phenomenon is more often considered to be an outcome of student characteristics (e.g., motivation, special needs) rather than a result of stringent decision rules. Findings stand to inform assessment validation, policy, and multivariate data use practices.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Archival Material", "edition_format": "Downloadable archival material : English", "summary": "\r\n   This study investigates the influences and constraints on data use pertaining to initial classification, reclassification, and educational programming for English Learners (ELs).

Such revamp involves a review of the effectiveness of English language education (ELE) in the country, which may be described as currently at a crossroads, as stakeholders strive to address issues of developing the English language competencies of Filipino students on the one hand, and the strengthening of academic achievement on the other. ELE in the Philippines, which began during the American colonial period in the nineteenth century, has been found wanting in significantly contributing to increased learning outcomes among Filipino students. ELE policies have been beset with issues of alignment and coherence in the areas of curriculum and assessment, as well as challenges in the implementation of genuine reform. In addition, ELE has been implemented at the expense of literacy in the mother tongues. This chapter provides an overview of how ELE in the Philippines is evolving - learning from past mistakes and preparing for the future. The chapter is divided into five major parts, namely, (1) overview of the Philippine educational system; (2) ELE from the American colonial period to Martial Law; (3) Bilingual education and educational reforms from 1974 to 2010; (4) Mother-tongue based multilingual education (MTBMLE) and the K to 12 reform; and (5) prospects and possibilities for ELE in the Philippines.

This chapter takes a chronological look, starting at free public education\u2019s onset to provide a foundation for the problems of inequality we face today. It then moves through the expanding federal role in the post-World War II years, followed by the battles over desegregation and the focus on providing resources to disadvantaged students. It then discusses standards-based reform, with a focus on how we arrived at the No Child Left Behind law and the issues surrounding the Common Core. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which targets impoverished students, is reviewed in detail. The lack of connection between Title I assignments and family income level, as well as lack of connection between Title I assignment and performance on the National Assessment of Academic Progress (NAEP), renders research results inconclusive in judging Title I\u2019s effects, but given that NAEP does show increasing average scores for Black and Hispanic students as well as declining gaps between those groups and White students, the evidence is sufficient that the program should be continued and improved.

NCSER 2014-3000", "author": "Carol M Connor", "abstract": "\n           Reading difficulties and disabilities present serious and potentially lifelong challenges. Children who do not read well are more likely to be retained a grade in school, drop out of high school, become a teen parent, or enter the juvenile justice system. Building on the extant research and seminal studies, including the National Reading Panel and the National Early Literacy Panel reports, research supported by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) has expanded understanding of ways to identify and help children who are at risk for reading disabilities. This body of work has also contributed to the identification of critical component skills that support proficient reading (e.g., phonological awareness, word knowledge, working memory), better ways to assess these skills, and more effective interventions for children at risk of developing reading difficulties, including children who are deaf or have intellectual disabilities. Research funded by IES has investigated ways to bring these efficacious interventions into our nation's classrooms by developing and evaluating professional development training that increases teachers' knowledge about literacy and how to teach reading effectively to all students, including students who are struggling to learn how to read. This is important because the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress reports that by fourth grade, one-third of our students are failing to attain basic reading skills. In this synthesis, the panel convened by IES, connects the building blocks of assessment, cognitive and linguistic components of reading, effective interventions, and teacher professional development to show how IES-funded research is contributing to solutions for improving reading and preventing reading difficulties. Based on the initial reading of the papers, and following an initial in-person meeting to discuss the articles that were read, the panel organized the contributions into four broad categories with component research questions. They are: (1) Assessment: What has been learned about effective identification and assessment of students who have or are at risk for reading difficulties or disabilities? (2) Basic Cognitive and Linguistic Processes: What are the basic cognitive and linguistic processes that support successful reading and how can these skills be improved for students who have or who are at risk for reading disabilities? (3) Intervention: How can reading instruction be more effective for students who have or are at risk for developing reading disabilities? How can reading be taught to students with low incidence disabilities? (4) Professional Development: How can research-based instructional practices be implemented in the classroom? These categories emerged directly from the articles that the panel members read and they reflect the areas the panel believes that IES-supported research has made contributions to in advancing the understanding of how to improve reading outcomes for students with or at risk for reading disabilities. For each  question, the panel synthesized the available research findings and highlighted key contributions. The panel was given the task of looking across the range of projects that IES has funded in this area to determine what has been learned, where progress has been made as a result of IES funding, and to provide suggestions for further research in improving reading skills of children with or at risk for reading disabilities. In reading this synthesis, readers should remember that it is not intended to be an overview of the existing research on improving reading for children with or at risk for reading disabilities. Panel members were only asked to review those published articles or book chapters that had emerged from IES-funded projects. Specifically, the panel was asked to review articles from peer-reviewed journals and book chapters from funded projects that were published or in press as of December 2011 (thus some articles that were in press in 2011 will have published dates in 2012 or 2013). Thus, there is a great deal of ongoing research that is not represented in this synthesis because some grants are not yet at the stage in the research process where findings are in and summarized for publication. Note also that reports of IES-funded research that have not been subjected to the peer-review process in publication are not included in this review.

As has been widely reported, the first randomized trial of Head Start in the program's history found some evidence that it is achieving this goal. Receiving one year of Head Start had small impacts on children's cognitive outcomes, with impacts on cognitive impacts concentrated in the language and literacy domain. However, effects largely faded out by the end of first grade (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). In explaining these results, some have pointed to the variation in quality across Head Start centers. This study uses data for the first follow-up year of the Head Start Impact Study to examine variation in Head Start's impacts on children. Researchers examine whether there is statistically significant variation in Head Start's impacts on children's cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes across individual children, subgroups of children, and Head Start centers. To do so, researchers use a new and innovative methodology for estimating sources of variation in program impacts. In total, 4,440 children in 202 center groups were randomized to treatment or control in the original Head Start Impact Study. The sample is comprised of the subset of children within these 202 center groups for whom there was outcome data available during the study's first follow-up year (N=3,785 children, or 85% of the children originally randomized). Children randomized to treatment were offered a seat in a classroom in a Head Start program in fall 2002 for the 2002-2003 school year. Children randomized to control conditions were free to take up any available early childhood program except for the program provided by the Head Start to which they had applied and had not won a seat. In fall 2002 and in spring 2003, study children were tested by a trained child assessor on an extensive battery of cognitive and socio-emotional assessments. Parents were also surveyed in fall 2002 and spring 2003 on basic demographic information and on dimensions of their children's behavior. Children were followed through third grade, and other data were gathered from various sources (e.g. additional child testing, teacher and center director interviews, direct observations of classroom quality). The analysis is based on data from the fall 2002 and spring 2003 child testing and parent survey only. One important feature of the analysis was comparison of residual outcome variances for treatment and control group members. The analysis of the statistical significance of across-center variance in impacts on children distinguishes between: (1) variation in program effect \"estimates\"; and (2) variation in program \"effects.\" Findings suggest that Head Start had impacts on individual residual variance that have not yet been recognized in analyses of these data. Specifically, Head Start reduced the individual residual variance for treatment group members versus control group members on two important early skills--receptive vocabulary and early math. These findings suggest that Head Start was successful in improving the vocabulary and early numeracy skills of children with lower levels of such skills at entry, with such effects concentrated among dual-language learners and Hispanic children.

The primary purpose of the Rhode Island Model Teacher Evaluation and Support System (Rhode Island Model) is to help all teachers improve. Through the Model, the goal is to help create a culture where all teachers have a clear understanding of what defines excellence in their work; are provided with prioritized, specific, and actionable feedback about their performance; and receive support to continuously improve their effectiveness, regardless of the number of years they have been teaching. The purpose of this Guidebook is to describe the process and basic requirements for evaluating and supporting teachers with the Rhode Island Model.

Nineteen Chinese teachers, who taught English as a foreign language in China, attended a short-term teacher-training program in Canada and had access to opportunities for authentic interaction with native English speakers. Another 19 Chinese EFL teachers who had never been to an English speaking country served as the comparison group. Twenty English native speakers were also recruited to provide native norms for the pragmatics assessment measures. Three research questions were addressed in this study. First, I examined what kind of interactive exposure was accessible to the study abroad teachers, and investigated what types of interactive activities might contribute to pragmatics learning. Second, I examined whether study-abroad teachers demonstrated approximation to native speaker norms with regard to requesting through two tests: a written discourse completion task (WDCT) and an appropriateness judgment task (AJT). Finally, I explored whether the study-abroad experience had increased teachers' confidence in teaching English pragmatics. The data analysis of the study-abroad teachers' logs showed that they were engaged in a much wider variety of English interactive activities than the at-home teachers. They also demonstrated a more significant growth in pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness in certain situations, but failed to acquire a full range of the native-like forms. Compared with native English speakers, the Chinese teachers used similar external modifiers, but less variety in request formulae and internal modification. They did not appear to realize that some strategies and formulae are context-based and scenario-specific. However, their confidence in teaching pragmatics was enhanced. The findings show that social interaction, cultural values, pragmatic transfer, social role, and living arrangement are factors affecting L2 pragmatic acquisition in a study-abroad context. The results also reveal that it is difficult for adult L2 learners to develop native-like pragmatic competence in a naturalistic setting, due to a lack of sufficient target language exposure, corrective feedback, and explicit pragmatic instruction.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   This study is a longitudinal investigation in the effectiveness of interactive exposure on the acquisition of English requests in a study-abroad setting.

For this reason, L1 and L2 learners of English are often directly taught to use their knowledge of English morphology as a useful reading strategy for determining parts of speech and meaning of novel words. Over time, use of morphological awareness skills while reading develops into an automatic process for L1 readers called morphological decomposition. While the practice of explicitly teaching morphological awareness skills is prevalent in ESL classes, more research is needed to establish what is known about gains in L2 morphological awareness, and its relationship to the development of automatic morphological decomposition processes in English language learners. The present study seeks to shed light on the nature of this relationship across growth in L2 proficiency. Two experimental measures were used: a masked priming paradigm with a lexical decision task to explore priming evidence for morphological decomposition and a paper and pencil test of morphological awareness which required subjects to derive the base of a morphologically complex word. These tasks were administered to L1 (N\u00a0=\u00a043) and L2 groups (intermediate N\u00a0=\u00a016, advanced N\u00a0=\u00a016) of university-aged subjects. Results indicated that all subjects show repetition priming effects. However, despite a significant gain in explicit knowledge of English morphology across proficiency levels, L2 learners don't develop an ability to morphologically decompose words in the unconscious, automatic way that native English speakers do, as evidenced by a lack of morphological priming. Implications for L2 pedagogy and L2 word storage in the mental lexicon are discussed.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   Morphological awareness facilitates many reading processes.

Using self-determination theory, this study examined how parents' socio-economic status (SES) and behaviours and beliefs about their children's English education influenced children's motivation to learn English in China. The participants were 198 fourth-, 191 sixth- and 183 eighth-grade students and their parents. Data were gathered using a series of surveys distributed to all the students and their parents, as well as interviews with 96 focus group students. Parents had substantial but varying influences on their children's motivation, depending on their SES backgrounds and their children's grade level. Whereas higher SES parents adjusted their behaviours according to their children's changing needs, lower SES parents tended to remain controlling and often failed to foster their children's self-competence and self-determined motivation. Higher SES parents' abilities to provide their children with greater opportunities to use English outside of school were increasingly advantageous for the children's development of self-determined motivation as their grade level increased.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   Schools in China and elsewhere are starting to teach English as a second language or foreign language (FL) to students at increasingly earlier ages.

Results indicated that SRSS scores were negatively correlated with SSiS-PSG scores, thereby suggesting that an increased behavioral risk is associated with decreases in teacher-reported reading performance, math performance, motivation to learn, and prosocial behaviors. In addition, the results yielded additional evidence of convergent validity with SSBD and SRSS scores. SRSS scores improved the chance estimates of predicting the internalizing behaviors of ELs (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.72) and externalizing behaviors of ELs (AUC = 0.98) as measured by the SSBD.

Complex theories and research studies are explained in a clear and comprehensible, yet non-trivial, manner without trivializing them. Practical examples of how to develop teaching materials and tasks from sound principles provide rich illustrations of theoretical constructs. The content is presented through a lively variety of different textual genres including classroom vignettes showing language teaching in action, question and answer sessions, and opportunities to 'eavesdrop' on small group discussions among teachers and teachers in preparation.

Within the framework of Myers-Scotton's highly influential Matrix Language Frame (MLF) model, Kelechukwu Ihemere explores the notion of asymmetry in Igbo-English codeswitching, arguing that the two languages do not contribute equally in the creation of mixed utterances. In the abstract interaction between the two grammars, the Matrix language is more activated than the Embedded language, resulting in either monolingual Igbo discourse or discourse with an Igbo morphosyntactic frame but with English insertions. Using both linguistic and quantitative analyses, this book uniquely investigates the governing principles and restrictions on bilingual clauses and grammatical codeswitching in the context of a West African language and English.

It prepares adults and younger learners to excel in the revised exam. An exciting new feature of this revised edition is the Ideas Generator. Test takers need to generate ideas to pass the Speaking and Writing papers of the exam. The Ideas Generator uses National Geographic videos to stimulate students' interest in common exam topics, help them build ideas about these topics and gather the language they need to effectively write or speak about them.

Model-based approaches were required for acceptable classification of students with RD in comprehension. Although the former finding is promising for early identification of students in need of more intensive instruction in lexical or fluency-based skills, the latter finding reaffirms literature attesting to the complexity of RD in comprehension and difficulty of predicting deficits using early measures of reading, which primarily assess word reading skill.

The data suggest that there are several factors that help pupils achieve good results in the NAK, especially practice and early English language learning and early language exposure. The purpose of the study was to determine the English language skills of the pupils in Slovenian schools who had organized, systematic English language learning in the first triad of the primary school in comparison to the English language skills of the pupils who did not have organized, systematic English language learning in the first triad of the primary school. The purpose was also to determine the impact of systematic English language teaching in the first triad of primary school on language knowledge of the fourth class pupils. A study was designed which was based on testing the English language skills on a sample of fourth class pupils, selected according to the form of English language learning in the first triad of primary school in Slovenia. The study was conducted in the 2015/2016 school year on a sample of 110 fourth class pupils divided into three groups. The experimental group consisted of 42 pupils who had organized, systematic early learning of English during the first triad. The first control group consisted of 17 pupils who did not have any kind of organized, systematic early learning of English in the first triad. The second control group consisted of 51 pupils who learned English as an extracurricular activity or took English language courses. All groups of pupils completed a questionnaire and took part in the language skills testing on different linguistic levels: lexical, grammatical and discourse levels. A language test was designed for this purpose. The results showed that the three groups were homogenous. Test results were compared within the three groups of pupils. The obtained data was also compared to the general, publicly available data of national sixth class testing (NAK). The analysis showed statistically significant differences in the test results of the three groups of pupils. Pupils who had organized, systematic early learning of English in the first triad achieved better results overall.

Moreover, children who are bilingual reap benefits in multiple developmental areas: cognitive, social, and emotional. However, these opportunities can go unrealized when schools and other social institutions lack the understanding required to respond sensitively to the particular needs of dual language learners. This brief compares national trends over time in academic achievement for students who are English language learners (ELLs) and their peers who are not English language learners.

ELs come into U.S. schools needing to learn the same grade-level content as their nonEL peers, but with the additional challenge of learning English--usually the language of instruction--as well. Although some approaches separate the two tasks, many researchers and practitioners call for integrating them, so that students do not miss content area instruction while they are learning English. One way to combine the two is sheltered instruction, which provides intentional linguistic and other supports to ELs to facilitate their learning of grade-level content (Echevarria, Short & Powers, 2008). As a recent review of the research makes clear, however, there is limited evidence to show the effectiveness of sheltered instruction (Goldenberg, 2013). Since the early 1990s, Project GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) has made claim to be a program that helps teachers meet diverse language and content needs within the mainstream classroom (Brechtel, 2001). Project GLAD is a multi-component K-12 instructional model designed to build academic English and grade-level content knowledge for students at varying levels of English language proficiency. The study discussed herein was a two-year cluster randomized trial in fifth-grade classrooms from 30 Idaho schools across 21 different districts. It focused on two research questions: (1) What is the impact of Project GLAD teacher training on fifth-grade students' reading comprehension, vocabulary, writing and science achievement in the treatment classrooms during the first of implementation, compared to a \"business as usual\" control group? and (2) Is the program impact different for ELs?

Given this context of underperformance, there is a need for educators to better understand the factors that are associated with their academic outcomes. Purpose: This national study examines demographic and school contexts of LM students as compared to their non-LM peers to highlight the disparities between them that extend beyond language differences. A nationally representative sample of LM students and their peers participated in this study, along with their parents and teachers, beginning with kindergarten in fall 1998 and continuing in first, third, and fifth grades. In particular, data on key student variables (race, gender, etc.) and the characteristics of their teachers were examined. Teacher characteristics included: years of experience, certification status, highest educational level achieved, and specialized coursework (reading methodology and ESL). By comparing descriptive statistics for LM students and their non-LM peers, the authors hoped to identify possible factors that may contribute to the achievement gap between these two groups. Research Design: For this descriptive and comparative study using secondary data, the authors analyzed a full sample of kindergarten students, including both LM and non-LM students (n = 15,026), in order to describe key demographic variables (i.e., gender, race, SES, etc.) for the two subgroups. Proportions for each subgroup variable and Fisher's exact test results were reported, in order to determine statistically significant differences between groups for categorical variables. The analytic subsample was then restricted to students from homes in the two lowest SES quintiles to compare mean values, associated t-tests, and histograms for five dimensions of teacher background to identify differences related to LM status. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study demonstrated some of the great disparities that exist between LM and non-LM students that go beyond language differences including: 70% of LM students come from the lowest SES group versus 37% of their non-LM peers. Also, teachers of LM students had fewer years of experience and lower rates of certification than teachers of non-LM students. Finally, many teachers of LM students (as much as 50% in first grade) reported feeling inadequately prepared to teach LEP (limited English proficient) students. These findings suggest the need for careful attention in the form of educational policies that acknowledge the disproportionate effect of poverty and low SES on LM students. The negative effects of limited resources and inadequate social capital overshadow limited English proficiency and their ability to overcome academic challenges. Furthermore, it is important for education decision-makers to recognize the role that inexperienced, uncertified teachers may play in the educational outcomes of LM students.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   Background: Educational outcomes for language minority (LM) children are of great concern across the nation because these students have lower grades, are rated by their teachers as having lower skills, perform worse on standardized tests, and are more likely to drop out than are non-LM students.

In Week 1, the instructor dictated 30 words from spelling word lists (Appendix A) designed for American children grades 6-8. Based on the results of this diagnostic dictation, the instructor and her thesis adviser chose five spelling rules to teach--one for each of the following five weeks. Each workshop lasted for one hour each week, and the procedure was the same each week-(1) pretest dictation of 15 words related to the spelling rule to be taught that week, (2) a lesson on the rule with sample words in sentences, and (3) a posttest dictation of the same 15 words. The instructor graded and returned these tests to students the following week, but due to time constraints, there was no follow-up instruction addressing patterns of errors she discovered in the posttests. Pre- and posttest results are presented, and an error analysis of each error for each student is included, which is especially helpful for ESL/EFL teachers who have little or no knowledge of Arabic.

QR is more appropriate when assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity are violated. Also QR has been recommended as a good alternative when the research literature suggests that explorations of the relationship between variables need to move from a focus on average performance, that is, the central tendency, to exploring various locations along the entire distribution. Although QR has long been used in other fields, it has only recently gained popularity in educational statistics. For example, in the ongoing push for accountability and the need to document student improvement, the calculation of student growth percentiles (SGP) utilizes QR to document the amount of growth a student has made. Despite its proven advantages and its utility, QR has not been utilized in areas such as language testing research. This paper seeks to introduce the field to basic QR concepts, procedures, and interpretations.

The CELDA 2014 conference aims to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agents systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aimed to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. The conference included the Keynote Lecture: \"Designing Learning Environments in a Digital Age: The Quest for What to Consider,\" by Professor Jan Elen, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, K.U. Leuven, Belgium.

This study examines the effectiveness of the Orton-Gillingham (OG) Method, a multisensory reading program where instruction utilizes two or more senses simultaneously. Originally developed in the 1930s as a program for dyslexic students, OG has seen continual use since its creation and is endorsed by the American Dyslexic Foundation and the International Dyslexic Foundation. Over the past two decades OG has increasingly been incorporated into general education settings in the primary grades as a reading intervention for struggling readers regardless of whether they have dyslexia. However, there is a dearth of research demonstrating its causal effect as a reading intervention for children with dyslexia or who are experiencing reading delays for other reasons. Two quasi-experimental methods, Regression Discontinuity Design and Nonequivalent Comparison Group Design with propensity scores, are used to test the efficacy of an OG-based, general education reading intervention on a sample of over 700 kindergarten and first grade students who are experiencing reading delays from a large district in California. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessments were used to assign students to the intervention and measure their end-of-year reading outcomes. The results of both analyses revealed no effect for students enrolled in the intervention in either kindergarten or first grade. Within the year that students received the intervention, a small but non-significant gain on end-of-year DIBELS composite scores was found. Long-term outcomes showed that over half of the students in the intervention were still not meeting reading targets by the end of second grade. Moreover, while the treatment effect was found to vary significantly across classrooms and across schools, no available measures classroom or school characteristics where associated with that variation. These findings suggest that certain applications of the OG methodologies may not be effective in general education settings.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   Delays in the development of early literacy skills are associated with a wrath of negative educational outcomes and so addressing such delays is one of the most pressing challenges in education.

A large and growing body of literature has revealed the negative effects of various accents as impairment to the ASR performance. Although English accents have been the most studied accent varieties insofar as it is regarded the most important and prestigious international language, Malaysian English (MalE) which signifies a new variety within New Englishes of non-native speakers is still unexplored. In the ASR market product nowadays, conventional way is to treat MalE as a uniform variety despite this notion is disputed by many scholars and researchers who regard MalE as implication of localized ethnic speech diversity. Past perceptual studies have reported high possibility of detecting ethnic identities from Singapore English (SgE) and Brunei English (BruE) speech as appropriate comparator varieties to MalE accents using listening test setup. At present, no research has been done to identify ethnic origin from speech samples of MalE accented speech using multiple speech analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms for automatic classification for more reliable, standard and accurate experimental methods. This study is an attempt to fill that gap and for this purpose, a new database of MalE accents has been developed. The study elicits speech in isolated-words and continuous speech from university students of both genders of three main ethnics to represent educated speakers of Malay, Chinese and Indian groups using selected accent-sensitive words from previous studies.

The 14 participants were part of an intermediate ESL class offered by a Midwestern community college in the U.S. The students were divided into three different levels: low, intermediate, and high. The students then were divided into three main mixed-level groups, and each group was given a handout with a different set of grammatical rules. Each group was asked to create a 16-item multiple-choice quiz based on the rules in the handout. Following this, each group entered another group's 16 multiple-choice quiz into the software program, Hot Potatoes. In the final stage, each group took a Hot Potatoes quiz made by another group whose work they had not yet been exposed to. In addition, the students studied a list of 16 prepositions outside of class; the list was not part of the project. The students took a pre-, post-, and delayed posttest and were interviewed about their opinions about the project and the list. The results of the one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that there was a significant gain in pre-post test scores for the project. Although preferences and scores did not correlate, qualitative findings suggest that the intermediate and high-level students preferred the project, whereas the low-level students preferred the list. Ten students used strategies that were used during the project, such as forming rules for prepositions or finding example sentences on the Internet, to help them study the list.

One area that is discussed among researchers is learners' proficiency and its effect on acquiring pragmatic competence. On one hand, researchers argue that learners need to have a high level of linguistic competence or proficiency in order to produce complex linguistic pragmatic functions. Researchers such as Codina-Espurz (2008) believe that there needs to be \"a certain degree of linguistic competence\" (p. 229) in order to gain pragmatic competence. In other words, lower L2 level learners may not find it beneficial to receive instruction since they lack the vocabulary to produce appropriate pragmatic responses. However, researchers have found that even having a high level of linguistic competence does not mean gaining complete native-like pragmatic competence (Bardovi-Harlig & Hartford, 1990; Hill, 1997). On the other hand, researchers suggest that pedagogical intervention even at the beginning level is beneficial (Tateyama et al., 1997; Wildner-Bassett, 1994). This study involves teaching pragmatic requests to adult English second language (ESL) learners of beginner and advanced intact classes at a non-profit organization called Meet Each Need with Dignity (MEND) in Pacoima, California. The study was of mixed methods, and data were collected using pre and posttests that included a written and oral role-play portion called a Discourse Completion Test (DCT), a Multiple-Choice assessment (MC), and a Background Questionnaire (BQ). Additionally, an interview and a delayed posttest were given three months later to one learner from each level to study the effect instruction had on their request development. Furthermore, this study wanted to find if pragmatic instruction had an effect on acquiring and producing appropriate responses to different request situations. The results showed that learners from both levels improved after explicit pragmatic instruction and developed different types of request expressions and modification items after intervention. Learners in both levels were able to move toward more native-like production by increasing the amount of conventional expressions used; however, the advanced learners were able to use a wider variety of expressions and modifiers. Overall, the results showed that instruction affected learners' awareness and ability to produce pragmatically appropriate responses in different sociopragmatic situations beneficially.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Computer File, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation ", "summary": "\r\n   Abstract: Second language (L2) learners are usually given a limited amount of exposure to pragmatic instruction even though researchers have advocated the importance of teaching pragmatics in the classroom (Alco\u0301n-Soler, 2008; Bardovi-Harlig, 1990; Cohen, 1996).
