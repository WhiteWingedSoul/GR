However, if the point comes where they want to study, take an exam or move up the work ladder, then the weaknesses in their writing will quickly be exposed. Obviously, there are many aspects of writing that teachers need to focus on: the finer points of grammar, how to structure sentences and paragraphs, even basic spelling - but using creative writing can add an extra dimension to writing. By allowing students to explore the writing process in a more creative way, we can give them confidence in their own writing and also encourage them to enjoy the process. Some may argue that creative writing isn't something that students will need to do in 'real life', but we need to think about how many of the tasks that we give students are used in real life and how many are just tools to develop skills that they will need. Students want to be able to write emails, tweets, Facebook updates, blog entries and text messages, as well as essays, reports and application forms.

Many issues can affect language skills. Language acquisition is key to communication skills and is complex, especially when viewed from the multicultural perspective related to second language learners. There is a difference between conversational language and academic language that must be considered when teaching adolescent English language learners (ELLs) that can influence the teacher\u2019s perception of an adolescent\u2019s language acquisition. Success in social language should not be mistaken for proficiency in the type and depth of English used in the classroom. Many language adolescent minority students possess conversational language, but experience academic failure because they lack cognitive academic language proficiency. Advocates for social justice education look to address the educational inequities facing ELLs since not all reading difficulties are disability related and sociocultural factors can be easily overlooked. These factors can lead to a higher rate of special education placement, especially for low-income minority students. Recognizing how second language learners function in academic contexts can greatly influence pedagogy. Classroom teachers can implement various pedagogies with positive results for their students related to language acquisition and application. One focus of these strategies is through the informal assessment of expressive language and application of classroom strategies and techniques to address noted student needs. This chapter will focus on social justice needs of adolescents by considering the theory of ELL language acquisition as well as approaches, techniques, and strategies.

To meet these aims, we observed and recorded reading/language arts instruction in 33 classrooms at three points during an academic year, and we assessed 274 students on vocabulary and comprehension at the beginning and end of the year. Using field notes and student utterances to understand the context, we coded teacher utterances (e.g., questions, comments, prompts) as vocabulary instruction, comprehension instruction, other instruction, or noninstruction. We then identified five types of vocabulary-related instruction and five types of comprehension-related instruction. Using latent difference modeling, we investigated how the frequency of different types of instruction was associated with change in students' vocabulary and comprehension across the school year. Teachers' instruction related to definitions, word relations, and morphosyntax was positively associated with change in vocabulary; teachers' instruction related to application across contexts and literal comprehension was negatively associated with change in vocabulary; and teachers' instruction related to inferential comprehension was positively associated with change in comprehension. The findings also revealed an interaction between language status and teachers' instruction, such that instruction that attended to comprehension strategies was associated with greater positive change in comprehension for bilingual (but not for monolingual) students.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship between teachers' instruction and students' vocabulary and comprehension in grades 3-5.

While suggesting some evocative poststructuralist pedagogical practices, the author focuses on diagnosing the fault lines of composition's refusal of poststructuralism rather than on providing \"solutions\" in the form of teaching templates.

Previous studies indicate that cognitive coaching is one form of professional development that can assist teachers in becoming self-directed practitioners who are able to reflect on their practice and adjust it to meet the needs of various learners, including linguistically diverse students (Batt, 2010; Costa & Garmston, 2002; Joyce & Showers, 2002). This study describes elementary teachers' perceptions of cognitive coaching in a linguistically diverse school: (1) In what ways do teachers perceive cognitive coaching as professional development? (2) How do observed teacher behaviors reflect cognitive coaching? and (3) What changes in their practice of educating linguistically diverse students do teachers report as a result of cognitive coaching? This basic qualitative study focuses on three elementary mainstream teachers educating linguistically diverse students and one coach who used cognitive coaching techniques. Using data from semi-structured interviews and coaching conversations, this study identifies the following emergent themes: elements of reflective practice, creating new instructional applications, embracing the diversity spectrum, facilitating teacher-driven learning, and promoting shared responsibility. The results of this study indicate that teachers who participated in cognitive coaching believe that they (1) reflect on their practice more and on a deeper level, (2) intentionally plan their instruction, (3) adjust their instructional plan in response to their students' needs using more formative assessments, and (4) value their work with the cognitive coach.

The CELDA 2014 conference aims to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agents systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aimed to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. The conference included the Keynote Lecture: \"Designing Learning Environments in a Digital Age: The Quest for What to Consider,\" by Professor Jan Elen, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, K.U. Leuven, Belgium.

The investigation was conducted with 38 adult Korean English learners of intermediate proficiency in a conversation course as part of a TESOL certificate program. Using a mixed methods approach to research, results from a task motivation questionnaire, a topic preference questionnaire, and interviews show that content associated with immediate personal life themes such as personal growth, human relationships, and life challenges is perceived to be more intrinsically interesting than that associated with more remote and abstract topics such as those related to global issues and current affairs. Consequently, incorporating life themes into adult-based courses, especially through story-based texts, may act as an important springboard for active motivational engagement during task-based interaction.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   This study investigates the influence of content-related conditions on adult second language learners' task motivation during interactive tasks.

Stephen Spector offers a new approach to learning Standard English grammar and usage. The product of Spector's forty years of teaching courses on the English language, this book makes the conventions of formal writing and speech easier and more enjoyable to learn than traditional approaches usually do. Each lesson begins with humorous, interesting, or instructive illustrative quotations from writers, celebrities, and historical figures. Mark Twain appears alongside Winston Churchill, Yogi Berra, Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, Stephen Colbert, Oprah, Lady Gaga, and many others. These quotations allow readers to infer the rules and word meanings from context. And if they stick in readers' memory, they can serve as models for the rules they exemplify. The lessons then offer short essays, written in a conversational style, on the history of the rules or the words being discussed. But because English is constantly changing, the essays offer not only the traditional rules of Standard English, but also the current opinions of usage panelists, stylists, and language specialists. When rules are controversial, Spector offers advice about stylistic choices. A companion website features a workbook with practice drills. This book will appeal to anyone who wants to write well.

The contributors are eminent researchers from the fields of philosophy of language, theoretical linguistics, and communication theory, who answer questions on this important issue. This exciting area of controversy has until now mostly been treated from the viewpoint of philosophy. This volume adds the views from semantics, conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. Authors address matters such as the issue of semantic minimalism vs. radical contextualism, the attribution of responsibility for the modes of presentation associated with Noun Phrases, and how to distinguish the indirect reporter\u2113\u0301\u2113s responsibility from the original speaker\u2113\u0301\u2113s responsibility. They also explore the connection between indirect reporting and direct quoting. Clearly indirect reporting has some bearing on the semantics/pragmatics debate, however, there is much controversy on \u2113\u0301\u2113what is said\u2113\u0301\u2113, whether this is a minimal semantic logical form (enriched by saturating pronominals) or a much richer and fully contextualized logical form. This issue will be discussed from several angles. Many of the authors are contextualists and the discussion brings out the need to take context into account when one deals with indirect reports, both the context of the original utterance and the context of the report. It is interesting to see how rich cues and clues can radically transform the reported message, assigning illocutionary force, and how they can be mobilized to distinguish several voices in the utterance. Decoupling the voice of the reporting speaker from that of the reported speaker on the basis of rich contextual clues is an important issue that pragmatic theory has to tackle. Articles on the issue of slurs will bring new light to the issue of decoupling responsibility in indirect reporting, while others are theoretically oriented and deal with deep problems in philosophy and epistem", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   This volume offers the reader a singular overview of current thinking on indirect reports.

In the abstract interaction between the two grammars, the Matrix language is more activated than the Embedded language, resulting in either monolingual Igbo discourse or discourse with an Igbo morphosyntactic frame but with English insertions. Using both linguistic and quantitative analyses, this book uniquely investigates the governing principles and restrictions on bilingual clauses and grammatical codeswitching in the context of a West African language and English.

Elbow's work has influenced generations of teachers and writers, but it has also met with criticism, particularly during the theoretical debates that dominated scholarship in rhetoric and writing in the late 1980s and 1990s. While scholars have debated whether Elbow is or isn't an expressivist--and the theoretical and pedagogical consequences if he were--less attention has been paid to Elbow's efforts to engage and embrace multiple audiences. In this thesis, I attempt to shift the scholarly conversation surrounding Elbow's work by arguing that Elbow's attention to audience provides a compelling and rich lens through which scholars can consider his work. My thesis examines the rhetorical strategies Elbow uses in order to make his texts accessible to a variety of readers: students, teachers, scholars, and the general public. It draws connections between Elbow's first book, Writing Without Teachers, his more traditional academic textbooks, and his essay collections, demonstrating that Elbow has been motivated by the same rhetorical impulses throughout his career, even as his situation as a writer and scholar have changed.

It examines learners' development of intercultural communicative competence (ICC) when engaging in community-based communication investigation activities. Seventeen learners participated in four communication investigations, three language log assignments, and several in-class activities that positioned them as researchers of their own and others' use of English. Data collection included learners' written work, audio recordings and transcripts of in-class discussions, and field notes of classroom observations. The following discourse and sociolinguistic frameworks informed the analysis: speech acts, pragmatics, participation structure, code switching, translanguaging, and intertextuality. Description of the learners' findings and analysis of their investigations illuminate their observations of authentic language use, strategies for participating in conversation, and the use of one text in the construction of another. Case studies of four learners reveal the specific learning strategies that they employed. These include referencing one's identities and roles when taking the floor in conversation, employing different languages (English, Haitian Creole, French) and registers, using repetition in conversation to serve multiple functions, asking different types of questions, and referring to previous texts to inform the topic and structure of one's own writing. A case study of the teacher/researcher demonstrates the ongoing development of her sociocultural awareness. The analysis explores what it means to acquire ICC while in early stages of language acquisition. Learners enacted their multicompetence through code switching, translanguaging, and applying previous knowledge to familiar and new genres of discourse. As learners gained entrance into and expanded participation in English-speaking and multilingual speech communities, they demonstrated the use of multiple registers and attention to contextualization cues. Ideology and asymmetries of power in relation to language use are addressed at the discourse, curricular, and national levels. This study exemplifies second language learning in language use. It illustrates beginning-level adult language learners as astute observers of communication and highlights the benefits of embracing the complexity of intercultural communication in early stages of second language acquisition. Implications for teachers pursuing a participatory approach to the development of ICC are identified. --Abstract.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : English", "summary": "\r\n   This dissertation presents action research conducted in a beginning-level course for adult learners of English for speakers of other languages.

This increase has led to challenges for all teachers, but especially content area teachers at the secondary level. ELLs struggle in content area classes, especially social studies, due to several reasons, including, their English language proficiency, the de-contextualized format of social studies text, enormous amount of vocabulary which is linguistically complex and abstract, and a lack of visuals within social studies text, among other issues (Brown, 2007; Cho & Reich, 2008; Lindahl & Watkins, 2010). One approach to improving ELLs' success in the secondary social studies classroom is through the use of home language practices. Many teachers are afraid to utilize the home language for many reasons. Through research these fears have been rebutted. With the belief that home language use is beneficial to ELLs in the social studies classroom, a curriculum was created around the NYS social studies framework and the American Journey textbook, for eighth grade ELLs a middle school with a high population of Spanish-speaking ELLs. This curriculum aims to assist teachers with having more success in educating their ELLs and supporting ELLs in attaining the necessary content area material in a more comprehensible manner. This curriculum includes 45 lesson plans that incorporate home language practices, along with home language materials, in order to teach three chapters of the American Journey textbook. -- author abstract.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : English", "summary": "\r\n   Over the past years the population of English language learners within United States' schools has increased (Castaneda & Misco, 2009).

However, little is known about how noun modification varies across the rhetorical sections of research articles. Such a perspective is important because it reflects the interplay between communicative function and linguistic form. This study used a corpus of empirical research articles from the fields of applied linguistics and language teaching to explore the connection between article sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion; IMRD) and six types of noun modification: relative clauses, ing-clause postmodifiers, ed-clause postmodifiers, prepositional postmodifiers, premodifying nouns, and attributive adjectives. First the frequency of these six types of noun modification was compared across IMRD sections. Second, the study also used a hand coded analysis of the structure and structural patterns of a sample of noun phrases through IMRD sections. The results of the analyses showed that noun modification is not uniform across IMRD sections. Significant differences were found in the rates of use for attributive adjectives, premodifying nouns, and prepositional phrase postmodifiers. There were no significant differences between sections for relative clauses, ing-clause postmodifiers, or ed-clause postmodifiers. The differences between sections for attributive adjectives, premodifying nouns, and prepositional phrases illustrate the way the functions of these structures intersects with the functions of IMRD sections. For example, Methods sections describe research methods, which often have premodifying nouns (corpus analysis, conversation analysis, speech sample, etc.); this function of Methods sections results in a higher use of premodifying nouns compared to other sections. Results for structures of noun phrase across IMRD sections showed that the common noun modification patterns, such as premodifying noun only or attributive adjective with prepositional phrase postmodifier, were mostly consistent across sections. Noun phrase structures including pre-/post- or no modification did have differences across sections, with Introduction sections the most frequently modified and Methods sections the least frequently modified. The different functions of IMRD sections call for different rates of usage for noun modification, and the results reflected this. The results of this research benefit teachers of graduate students of applied linguistics in students' research reading and writing by describing the use of noun modification in the sections of empirical research articles and aiding teachers in the design of materials to clarify the use of noun modification in these IMRD sections.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : State or province government publication : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   Previous research has established the importance of the nouns and noun modification in academic writing because of their commonness and complexity.

The phenomena of stubbornness, however, would seem to suggest that, despite our efforts, there are times when rhetoric just doesn't work. This dissertation complicates this premise, and in so doing complicates common understandings of both stubbornness and rhetorical effect. As I argue, rhetorical effects exist within a complex rhetoric system, within which they circulate and are interconnected with a diversity of other rhetorical and non-rhetorical elements. Using N. Katherine Hayles's concept of \"making the cut,\" I argue that within such complex systems, stability and change are tangled up in an interdependent relationship; in short, in order for complexity to exist it must be constrained by contingent stabilities. These necessary stabilities mask the way that systems are always moving, and so we often do not see changes in the rhetoric systems we inhabit. In this sense, these changes are  compensatory, and they work to maintain a stability that can manifest precisely as stubbornness. In delineating what I call a \"rhetoric-systems\" approach, this dissertation maps the stabilities and movements of several different rhetoric systems, and provides new insight into the complex and relational movement of rhetorical effect. Our use of this approach asks us to recognize the existence and value of certainty and stability, and  then to pull back and recognize the existence of complexity and change. The approach integrates insights from systems theory (and so from the sciences) into existing rhetorical theory, and in so doing models an interdisciplinary approach to public rhetorics and writing studies that is firmly grounded in rhetorical theory.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   In deliberative argument, in political discourse, in teaching, and in casual conversation, as rhetors we often hope that our attempts at interaction will have some effect on the participants in these discursive environments.

Notably, these discussions revolve around ensuring students are ready to cross the threshold between high school and college writing, and around giving them the tools they need to bridge the gap. With few avenues for conversation or collaboration with university faculty, high school teachers aiming to prepare students for college writing sometimes feel as though they are \u201cin the dark\u201d (Davies, 2006). This perennial separation means that secondary teachers, who are charged with preparing their students for college with little current knowledge about expectations in college courses, end up reifying \u201cdivides\u201d and \u201cgaps\u201d separating high school and college. My study considered Concurrent Enrollment (CE) composition programs as one model for attempting to facilitate communication and collaboration between high school and college stakeholders. To investigate the potential CE programs have to serve as learning opportunities for CE teachers, this dissertation was guided by the question: \u201cHow do teachers\u2019 Discourses, material and relational resources, and identities interact to mediate their learning in practice?\u201d Conceptually, this paper begins with King Beach\u2019s \u201cconsequential transitions\u201d framework (1999, 2003). Beach\u2019s developmental view of knowledge propagation provides a framework for understanding learning as \u201cthe construction of new knowledge, ways of knowing, and new positionings of oneself in the world\u201d (Beach, 2003, p. 42). Consequential transitions help not only to conceptualize the \u201ctrajectory\u201d of an individual\u2019s development, but they also help to situate an individual\u2019s development within the context of settings, practices, and identities. CE teachers\u2019 work is impacted by multiple settings (classroom/school/district/community and the university setting), making attending to settings critical for this research. Thus, as a complement to Beach\u2019s framework, this research takes up the situative perspective of learning (Gee, 2008; Greeno, 2005; Putnam & Borko, 2000; Sawyer & Greeno, 2009). The situative perspective views learning as emerging from \u201cinteractions between people and resources in the setting\u201d (Sawyer & Greeno, 2009, p. 348). Within settings, focal teachers engaged in the practices of planning and teaching the CE course and, in so doing, they were becoming socialized into a new secondary Discourse for writing instruction. In this process, their established Discourses for teaching and teaching writing (rooted in their prior work and existing settings) interacted with their attempts to become fluent in the Discourse(s) of writing pedagogy of the CHS course (Gee, 2008; 2015). Furthermore, to support an analysis of teacher learning with consequential transitions as a frame, teacher identity was a significant consideration because it mediated how teachers negotiated their roles within contexts, thereby directly impacting their teaching practice and the transformation of that practice over time (Enyedy et al., 2005). Thus, this dissertation employed the construct of identities in practice (Holland et al., 1998; Kanno & Stuart, 2011; Lave, 1996; Wenger, 1998; Varghese, Morgan, Johnston, & Johnson, 2005), which posits that there is a \u201cmutually constitutive relationship between identity and practice\u201d (Kanno & Stuart, 2011, p. 240). To investigate both the experience of individuals and the settings in which they work and develop, my study employed a qualitative case study design to bring together these multiple, complex strands of inquiry (Merriam, 2009). I used purposeful sampling (Patton, 2003) to select three novice CE teachers in a College in the High School (CHS) program operated by a large, public four-year university in the Western United States. Three main sources of data inform the present analysis: (1) Interview data collected from the three focal teachers and key individuals in the contexts of their work, (2) field note data from classroom observations and observations of CHS program meetings held at the university, and (3) documents and artifacts collected from the high school contexts of the focal teachers and the university context. Questions on the semistructured interview protocols (Merriam, 2009) aimed to understand teachers\u2019 experiences, their understandings of their work, the nature and influence of their settings, and their navigation of roles in teaching the CE course. Interview data were triangulated with analysis of field notes and collected documents and artifacts (Merriam, 2009). Structured within- and cross-case analysis of data from the three sources was employed to understand the complexities of CE teachers\u2019 practice and development (Miles, Huberman, & Salda\u00f1a, 2014). I used a number of tools to analyze my data, including: coding using qualitative analysis software; writing within and cross case analytic memos; and creating data displays. This multi-tiered approach allowed analysis to be at once informed by literature and \u201ccapture novel findings [in] the data\u201d (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 541). The analysis of qualitative data yielded a number of compelling findings. Firstly, while the three focal teachers taught in very different environments with different established Discourses, for teaching, writing, and teaching writing, there were trends among how their uptake of CHS frameworks and practices interacted with their situated sense-making processes. Firstly, areas of alignment and affiliation acted as entry points that allowed teachers to take up CHS practices and then encouraged them to continue taking up unfamiliar or uncomfortable practices and ideas. Secondly, when moments of disjuncture among frameworks and cultures were approached as opportunities to investigate questions or problems, seek resources or guidance, or engage in reflective practice, they resulted in productive friction that furthered focal teachers\u2019 sense-making processes. Ultimately, each teacher\u2019s established Discourses provided the \u201cbasis on which\u201d the CHS Discourse(s) were learned (Gee, 2008; 2015). More than this, each teacher\u2019s response to these dynamics shaped the nature, the efficiency, and the depth of his or her sense-making and appropriation of CHS course concepts, practices, cultures, and frameworks. This sense-making played out while teachers engaged in their day-to-day teaching practice. As focal teachers responded to uncertainty in their ability to plan instruction by reaching out and collaborating, by engaging in cycles of instruction and reflection, and by responding to the needs of their students, they \u201cconstructed and reconstructed\u201d the knowledge they needed to teach the CHS course successfully in their contexts. Moreover, as teachers interacted with CHS resources in planning and instructional practice, they refined the resources to their purposes and they developed their understanding of both the resources and the concepts represented by them such that they were able to use them in increasingly sophisticated ways. In these ways, teachers' ability to practice and to learn was impacted by features of their settings. They were, simultaneously, engaged as active agents in the cultivation of their knowledge of new concepts and practices that impacted their settings. Through engagement in daily practice, focal teachers also experienced becoming a \u201cnew kind\u201d of high school teacher via complex processes of identity craftwork (Beach, 2003). Findings suggest, in line with Holland and colleagues (1998) that, \u201cThe degree to which an individual forms an identity relevant to a figured world \u2026 depends upon his relative level of engagement and identification with that world\u201d (p. 189).", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : State or province government publication : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   In today\u2019s educational climate, in which preparing all K-12 students to succeed in college and career is paramount, a prominent concern is to ensure that students leave high school with \u201ccollege level\u201d writing skills (Acker & Halasek, 2008; Crank, 2012; Moss & Bordelon, 2010).

Recent composition scholarship, such as Christine Farris and Kristine Hansen's College Credit for Writing in High School: The \"Taking Care of\" Business, addresses the acceleration of these courses, questioning the extent to which the efficiency of dual credit designates writing as a \"commodity easily appropriated, sold, outsourced, and knocked off\" (272). My project further studies the implications of accelerated writing courses by interviewing dual-credit students, instructors, and administrators at one sponsoring university and four local high schools in order to examine stakeholders' conceptions of literacy in a context defined by \"college readiness\" and financial sponsors of education. Drawing from scholars who study the relationship between literacy, context and institutional power, such as David Barton, Mary Hamilton, and Deborah Brandt, I consider stakeholders' conceptions of literacy in a site that emphasizes students quickly accumulating college credit, and the assumptions about literacy education which privilege this acceleration. Through data employed from interviews with twenty stakeholders and course and program documents, I argue that dual-credit writing courses highlight the tensions in the role of composition as a field because of the pressure to define a certain kind of \"college-level writing\" in order to prepare students for careers. Specifically, this project demonstrates how stakeholders' conceptions of \"college ready\" moved the conversation on literacy education from being about a finite set of skills to perceptions of socioeconomic and educational identity of students and schools. A close look at the level of commitment to \"college readiness\" at this institutional setting emphasizes that acceleration also connects to financial sponsorship because stakeholders discussed how dual credit serves as a financial deal for both the students because they receive one-third the tuition rate and for the university because mostly secondary educators and part-time lecturers teach the course. Therefore, I argue for more awareness of how these institutional pressures inform literacy not only in dual-credit classrooms, but writing instruction at the university overall.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   This dissertation addresses how as dual-credit offerings rise, university writing programs work to respond to the pedagogical, material, and institutional concerns that inform teaching \"college-level writing\" in this unique space.

This was important for English-speaking and Spanish-speaking FCC providers because regardless of the language spoken, we all can learn from each other when we share our experiences. They can learn about the struggles we all have in common to make life work. Therefore, I hope to make a contribution to this group of women that taught me that we can make our dreams come true if we set our minds to it. They were the ones who inspired me to go back to school and make a small contribution to my community by providing classes that implement new teaching techniques instead of using conventional methods. The alternative methods include: mentoring and transformative education techniques. These new methods will make learning more meaningful and each person will be able to use the existent knowledge each student possess as a way to teach others. I strongly believe that by addressing the needs indicated by the FCC Providers, such as providing the opportunity to work in small groups, being able express their ideas, and learn from others, will benefit FCCs more by staying away from the traditional teaching methods that do not serve the unique needs of these women. Just like children learn from the classroom environment, from each other and through hands on play, these same factors will be considered as optimal factors to design and implement a workshop for the FCC Providers using transformative education methods. By implementing transformative education techniques that includes: ways to facilitate conversation, require participation from all members, engage in hands-on activities, and provide prompts for self --reflection and consistent dialogue, FCC providers experienced a unique educational design created to their individual need and learning style. I hope that my participants can identify that they already have a lot of knowledge in many subjects that they can share with to others.", "coverLink": "http://coverart.oclc.org/ImageWebSvc/oclc/+-+965748414_140.jpg?SearchOrder=+-+OT,OS,TN,GO,FA", "sellerName": null, "sellerLink": null},

Upperintermediate English language learners were invited to participate in this study on a voluntary basis. In Study 1, one group of the learners (n = 60) performed a simple and a complex version of an argumentative writing task, and their writing production was measured in terms of syntactic complexity, accuracy, lexical complexity, and fluency (CALF), as well as the organisation, content, and overall written text quality. In Study 2, one group of the learners (n = 40) performed the simple and complex tasks under 10-minute pre-task planning and another group (n = 40) under no-pre-task planning conditions. The learners' writing production was compared using the same measures employed in Study 1. In Study 1, increasing task complexity led to a significant desirable change in one dimension of both syntactic and lexical complexity, had a significant adverse effect on accuracy and fluency, and led to the enhancement of L2 content, organisation, and writing quality. As regards the mediating role of motivation and anxiety, significant moderate negative associations were found between some dimensions of maladaptive approaches to learning and some measures of L2 writing production in the complex writing task performance. Conversely, significant moderate positive correlations were found between some aspects of adaptive approaches to learning and some measures of L2 writing production in the complex L2 writing task performance. In Study 2, a similar trend was found for the effect of increasing task complexity along the level of reasoning and the number of elements as in Study 1.

Through the fascinating stories of thirty English words used and understood in nearly all corners of the globe, The English Is Coming! takes readers on an eye-opening journey across culture and commerce, war and peace, and time and space. These mini-histories shed new light on everyday words: the strange turns of fate by which their meanings evolved and their new roles as the building blocks of the first language ever to forge a global community. Exploring such familiar terms as shampoo (from a Hindi word for scalp and body hygiene long practiced in India); robot (coined by Czech painter Josef Capek for his brother Karel's 1921 play about man-made creatures); credit (rooted in a prehistoric phrase of sacred significance: \"to put heart into\"); and dozens of others, Dunton-Downer reveals with clarity and humor how these linguistic artifacts embody the resilience, appeal, adoptability, and wild inclusiveness that English, through a series of historical accidents, gained on its road to worldwide reach. These words explain not only how English has managed to link our distant and often disparate pasts but also how it is propelling humankind to a future that we can, for the first time, talk about and shape in a language that now belongs to all of us: Global English.

John Trimbur (2000) was the first forecast the redevelopment of the writing center as a multiliteracy center to respond to this trend--a reference to the New London Group's (1996) call to expand education beyond word-based definitions of literacy. This dissertation takes advantage of the increasingly important conversation about multiliteracy centers (and the related conversation about multimodal composing in composition studies) to conduct a qualitative study of current practice in multiliteracy centers. Primarily, this project examines the role a multiliteracy center can play in supporting and promoting multimodal composing by analyzing three forms of data: a nationwide online survey of writing center professionals, interviews with six administrators of established multiliteracy centers, and site visits to two newly-established multiliteracy centers. Survey data presents a broad view of the state of multimodal composing in writing centers, and also indicates that participants in the survey believe multimodal composing is important both for the future of writing centers and because of the educational value these projects provide to students. Interviews with multiliteracy center administrators identify common successful practices and common challenges for established multiliteracy centers, and these interviews also suggest that the multiliteracy center can be a leader on campus on this issue through using writing center resources and collaborating with institutional partners. Observations and interviews at two newly-established multiliteracy centers demonstrate that multiliteracy centers can provide support to student populations most writing centers already serve but also to less familiar populations, such as students preparing posters and presentations in the hard sciences or engineering. Additionally, the multiliteracy center can help students with multimodal projects that benefit organizations outside of the university. Ultimately, this dissertation concludes that an expanded definition of multiliteracy center work can benefit students and faculty in composition and across disciplines, as well as members of the larger community.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   In the past decade, writing centers have grappled with the increased attention to multimodal composing on college campuses, such as projects composed using a combination of words, images, sounds, and movements.

Comparison-group research was employed to assess differences in ELLs' learning with computer simulations demonstrating Newton's Third Law in comparison to learning with a traditional hands-on laboratory approach.  My expectations were that computer simulations would be advantageous to ELLs, regardless of the individual learners' language proficiency levels.  I expected that a comparison ELL group engaged in hands-on laboratory experiments would not perform as well as learners in the computer simulations group.  A total of 44 ELL students were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (computer simulations group, n = 22; traditional laboratory group, n = 22).  Within each treatment group, smaller groups of 3 to 4 students were randomly assigned to work together, resulting in 7 smaller computer simulations groups and 7 smaller traditional hands-on laboratory groups (Appendix D).  Attrition resulted in a total of 30 students distributed into treatment groups (computer simulations group, n = 20; traditional laboratory group, n = 10).  Data collected for comparison included two measures of conceptual understanding.  Gain scores were calculated for pre- and posttest FCI questions.  Student journal entries and videotaped speech transcriptions were analyzed and transformed into quantitative frequencies and percentages.  Results confirmed simulations assisted ELLs in grasping concepts but didn't support simulations as encouraging conceptual conversation.  Results indicated that ELLs learning with simulations were not at a disadvantage in understanding concepts even though they discussed and made fewer journal entries than ELLs learning with traditional hands-on approach. Exploratory in nature, this comparative study was the first of its kind to explore ELLs' conceptual understanding comparing computer simulations and hands-on instructional approaches.  The results of this study lead to recommendations for a more extensive examination of ELLs' use of computer simulations to reinforce ELLs' learning of abstract physics concepts.  However, several implications for classroom practices emerged from the findings of this exploratory study. Implications, which are discussed in the final section of the dissertation, include classroom practices related to misconceptions, scaffolding, assisting learners in grasping abstract concepts, and reinforcing conceptual understanding.

I examine existing concepts of play in both rhetorical and composition theory and put them in conversation with play theory such as Brian Sutton-Smith's The Ambiguity of Play and Jan Huizinga's classic, Homo Ludens. I propose that rhetorical theory treat play as a resource used by humans symbolically to express ideas, shape beliefs, and persuade audiences in computerized media such as videogames, virtual environments, and wikis. In my first chapter, I argue that using Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman's definition of play as \"free movement within a more rigid structure\" (Rules of Play 304) allows rhetoric and composition scholars to visualize play as composing through exploration, experimentation, and user experience. I also provide an overview of the project. In my second chapter, I analyze the articles in a 2008 special issue of Computers and Composition about videogames. Drawing from Brian Sutton-Smith's work in The Ambiguity of Play, I argue that explicit uses of the word play in the emerging area of gaming studies embody three theories of play in rhetoric and composition: theories of 1) experimentation, 2) subjectivity, and 3) ambiguity. In my third chapter, I revisit Johan Huizinga's Homo Ludens. Drawing from the work of archival scholar William Otterspeer, I argue that Huizinga's work has been largely misunderstood in rhetoric and composition. Further, I claim that by understanding Huizinga's methodology and theory of language, scholars can arrive at a new reading of Homo Ludens, one that illustrates Huizinga's theory of symbolic play. In my fourth chapter, I propose a theory of the language of play, which is a theory of how human play takes on symbolic forms that express rhetorical meaning in the possibility spaces created by computable media. In my final chapter, I bring the language of play to bear on the WPA OS and argue that play's symbolic forms can help the field both articulate and realize the core values articulated in the Outcomes Statement.\"--Abstract.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   \"My dissertation proposes a rhetorical theory of how human play is symbolized in the possibility spaces created by computable media.

These students are called beginning writers and they need one-on-one help and specialized assignments to help them understand and learn how to write on the college level. This thesis provides and explains the benefits of three methods that can be implemented in a composition course to help beginning writers succeed in the academy. These three methods are one-on-one conferencing, peer tutoring, and specialized/scaffolded writing assignments. One-on-one conferencing is beneficial to all students, but particularly beginning writers because it gives students the personalized help and attention they need with surface level concerns and writing process problems that they may not get in class because those issues are not class wide. Spending time with beginning writers allows teachers to observe their writing process and listen to their writing problems, which can be done both in class and out of class repeatedly throughout the course. Peer tutoring is effective with beginning writers because it is informal and conversation-like. Also, a peer tutor's availability can make her particularly helpful for a beginning writer because she can serve as his support system as she helps him move from being worried about surface level concerns to content level concerns throughout repeated sessions. The specialized assignments presented were not created expressly with beginning writers in mind; however, they can still be implemented to help beginning writers ease into traditional academic writing, while at the same time not making mainstream writers feel like they are being taught down to. Beginning writers should be eased into writing a formal academic essay by using reading and creative nonfiction assignments throughout the class. This will help them feel more comfortable with academic writing when they leave the course. Basically, in order for beginning writers to succeed in the academy, they need help during the writing process in order to receive help when they want it, and receive encouragement when they need it. They need support, whether from teacher or tutor, to guide them through learning this new way of writing they've never encountered before. They need to be taught how to write on the college level through assignments which give them a foundation and then build from it, rather than assignments that presume they already know how to write this way. Understanding the needs and realities of beginning writers is a great first step in helping them not only learn college-level writing, but also learn that they are just as capable as their peers of flourishing in college. By conducting frequent one-on-one conferences, encouraging students to get help from a peer tutor, and by creating course assignments with their preparedness level in mind, composition instructors in all colleges can help beginning writers succeed in college and beyond.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   Many students entering college are underprepared for the level of writing expected of them, and therefore they struggle through their courses beginning with first year composition.

In particular, this dissertation, a classroom ethnography, examines how the originality burden-an encumbrance wherein students feel overwhelmed by the need to write an \"original\" paper-operates in one second-semester first-year composition course dedicated to relieving students from feeling like they must write \"original\" texts. More specifically, this study examines the potential of two concepts, remix and intertextuality, to help show students that writing, and language more generally, always builds on what came before, therefore reducing the possibility that any text is truly original. This dissertation begins with an overview and literature review of what a term like originality means within the context of a first-year writing course, acknowledging the cultural history that influences how students understand originality (including the development of the solitary author, copyright law, and plagiarism) and the way that digital media has come to change what it means to author an \"original text.\" Chapter 2 outlines the methodology of the study, describing how the study site was selected, the data collection procedures used, and the data sources. Chapters 3 and 4 report the results of my research. In Chapter 3, I focus on how the instructor of the course used the term remix to explain to her students the ways in which language and writing are intertextual. This chapter describes how students used the term remix as a qualifier for the kind of writing they produced, rather than as what all writing could be labeled. That is, Chapter 3 discusses why students felt that their academic texts were remixed texts but that texts produced by more experienced writers, such as their professors, were original. In Chapter 4, I examine how an intertextual practice many students were familiar with before entering the composition classroom, the digital remix, helped alleviate the originality burden while at the same time creating a greater disconnect between digital remixed writing and more traditional academic remixed writing. Finally, Chapter 5 describes the theoretical and pedagogical implications of my findings, the limitations of this research project, and areas for future research.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   This dissertation contributes to ongoing conversations regarding the goal of composition instructors \"to empower students to take responsibility for their ideas and their texts while developing their curiosity and persistence in the pursuit of knowledge\" (Carpenter, 2014, par. 4).

The model that was used was based on integrating translanguaging, a common language practice of bilingual and multilingual individuals who frequently use more than one language in a sentence or a conversation. I used translanguaging as a pedagogical strategy by providing copies of the novel, The Giver by Lowis Lowry (1993) in English and Spanish to each student. In addition I encouraged students to respond in English and Spanish to demonstrate their understanding of the content. The Power of Our Bilingual Voices : Translanguaging with Middle School English Language Learners was implemented in a sixth through eighth grade English Language development classroom. The activities in the curriculum are designed to allow students to use Spanish as well as English to more accurately communicate their understanding of the content. The majority of the students used English and Spanish to actively participate in whole group discussions. Some students also used both languages in writing. I found that students became more accurate and reflective from the beginning of implementation to the end of implementation according to interview results, field notes and student work samples. In addition, I found that students referenced their English and Spanish novels differently based on the type of question asked.

The educational language policy for Arizona's public schools (during the 2014-2015 school year) mandates SEI include four 60-minute classroom periods devoted to reading, writing, grammar, oral English exclusively. Students in SEI thus have restricted access to the full-range of general education courses required for graduation, as well as limited opportunities for social interaction with peers enrolled in the \"mainstream\" curriculum. The study investigates how youth understand and navigate the school language policy, practices and discourses that position them, and specifically seeks to learn how being identified as an \"English Language Learner\" interacts with youths' construction of academic and social identities. Adopting a critical sociocultural theory of language policy (following McCarty, 2011), employing ethnographically-informed research methods, and using social-positioning as an analytic lens, I aim to learn from an emic youth perspective and to amplify their voices. Eight Somali and two Iraqi students took part in two individual in-depth interviews; five students participated in a focus group; and all engaged in numerous informal conversations during 22 researcher site visits to an ethnic community-based organization (ECBO) and a family apartment. Narratives recounting the participants' lived experiences in the socio-cultural context of high school provide powerful examples of youth asserting personal agency and engaging in small acts of resistance to contest disagreeable positioning. The findings thus support the conceptualization of youth as creative producers of hybridity in response to their environments. This work also confirms the perennial significance of social categories and \"othering\" in high school. Though the institutional structure of separate classrooms and concomitant limited access to required courses hinder the study participants' academic progress, the youth speak positively about the comfort of comradery and friendship in the shared safe space of the separate SEI classroom.

The research presented focuses on how mass/count (countability) information is processed at the lexical syntactic and conceptual-semantic levels. Chapter 1 reviews and discusses previous research with language unimpaired and impaired speakers and its theoretical implications for the representation of countability information in language production and comprehension. Results support the assumption that nouns have lexical-syntactic specification for countability. Chapter 2 investigates processing of mass and count nouns and their determiners during noun phrase production with language unimpaired speakers in two picture-word interference experiments. Results showed countability congruency effects which indicate that mass/count information is represented at the level of lexical-syntax and that mass/count specific determiners compete for selection. Chapter 3 and 4 present single case studies (one in Chapter 3 and two in Chapter 4) which examine possible selective impairments of mass noun lexical-syntax in three aphasic individuals with grammatical impairment. These investigations provide further evidence for the lexical-syntactic representation of mass/count information. A series of mass/count specific tasks was used to systematically investigate countability processing in language production and comprehension. Two of the individuals, RAP (Chapter 3) and DEH (Chapter 4), were found to suffer from a lexical-syntactic impairment which affected processing of mass noun grammar and led to frequent substitutions of mass noun determiners by count noun determiners. The third case study describes (Chapter 4) the individual GEC, whose conceptual semantic impairment affected naming of mass nouns. Results of the case studies not only provide further evidence that nouns and determiners are specified for countability at the level of lexical-syntax but also reveal that this lexical-syntactic information can be influenced by conceptual-semantic information which is activated by visual properties of the stimuli. The research presented in this thesis provides evidence that nouns are lexical-syntactically specified for mass and count and that activation of this information is required for the selection of countablity congruent determiners.

A quasiexperimental research designed was adopted. The treatment sample of this study consisted of four teachers of listening and their students (in total of 100). The study was conducted in two phases, the baseline and intervention, with the former lasting for three weeks, and the latter sustained over approximately four months. In the baseline, data of students' listening scores, since their admission to the university, and teachers' opinions about teaching listening skills and computer use were collected in the form of pre-intervention teacher questionnaires and informal conversations. In the intervention phase, the teachers were invited to a training workshop on computer skills, and received weekly coaching sessions on selecting and using online resources for listening instruction in class. The intervention classes were taught with these supplementary online resources while the comparison classes (the other four classes) were taught in the traditional way (i.e. listening classes were supplemented with extra listening books selected by their teachers). Comparisons in terms of students' listening performance were made between the two groups. Data from the baseline and intervention showed that the students in the intervention classes performed better in terms of language-related skills and listening skills than the comparison students. Both the intervention students and their teachers were highly motivated and had positive attitudes toward computer use in listening classes. Besides that, the students in the intervention classes were observed to have increased their autonomy. In addition, the intervention teachers became more confident in using computers and gained better skills in selecting effective sources from the Internet for listening instruction. The study suggests that computer use in listening instruction should be given much more consideration so as to increase the listening skills, motivation and learner autonomy of EFL students, as well as to enhance motivation and computer self-efficacy of EFL teachers in Vietnamese tertiary institutions.

When we write about the things we are learning, we are better able to distinguish what is known from the unknown. Through writing, we foster further complex conceptions that we may not realize otherwise. In addition, we are better able to organize the disordered thoughts we often have. As we develop clearer thoughts, our writing improves. These concepts are the basis of the \"learning- through- writing\" rally cry of Writing Across the Curriculum research.  Research studies by scholars such as Toby Fulwiler conclude that instructors of all subjects can engage students in a range of shared language skills to improve learning while simultaneously strengthening the abilities taught by language arts teachers. Ideally, \"a Writing Across the Curriculum program... places some responsibility for language instruction with every teacher\" (1982). If we accept Fulwiler's findings that language skills and content knowledge development can and should be interwoven, then it is logical to further research in less explored areas by finding a place for \"writing to learn\" practices within athletics as well. I believe reflective journaling is that avenue because it can open new dialogues between coaches and athletes, and athletes with themselves. These conversations help point to critical, individual, athletic performance areas that need more development or demonstrate to the coach that a student displays greater understanding of a concept or skill. This thesis illustrates one way that journaling can help students to explore the uses of writing while furthering their understanding of wrestling and themselves. This research furthers the applications of expressive (reflective) writing techniques and Writing Across the Curriculum theories and pedagogies in athletics to demonstrate how journal writing that reflects personal experience enhances learning.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   Writing and thought are a continuum; each promotes the other.

The objective of this study was to examine fourth grade ELL reading processes of expository text. The theoretical framework will be based on Goodman's sociopsycholiguistic theory (1984) in that reading utilizes thought and language as a process to construct meaning. Therefore, reading is a constructive process in which the reader interacts with the text to create meaning. Cummins (1979) suggests that underlying proficiencies are important in building strong L1 to transfer to L2, and Krashen (1992) suggests that the Natural Approach hypothesis provides the means for comprehensible input. These theoretical frameworks on second language acquisition support the idea that an ELL's background knowledge gained through social experiences provides comprehensible input to create meaning while reading in any language. The two guiding questions for the study were 1) How do 4th grade ELLs process expository text? And 2) How do 4th grade ELLs describe reading processes after reading expository text? The findings suggest that ELLs were challenged by content words as 92% of the miscues on content words caused meaning change. In addition, the findings of this study suggest that ELL readers seem to be familiar with graphophoneme aspects of content words, but still make syntactic or semantic miscues without self-correction. And, the ELL readers in this study appear to use grapho-phonics in their reading processes.

Join Stephanie Harvey and Anne Goudvis, authors of Strategies that work, in Barb Smith's reading workshop as her students begin to explore the wild and wooly world of nonfiction where merely getting the facts isn't enough. Nonfiction readers need to merge their thinking with the information to learn, understand, and remember it. In Think nonfiction!, the focus is on comprehension strategies for gaining information - specifically noticing new learning, asking questions, and determining importance. We watch Stephanie and Anne teach alongside Barb as she launches a nonfiction study and helps kids learn how to read for information, choose a topic, and do research. Stephanie does a mini-lesson to model how she stops and thinks when she encounters new information as she reads. Anne and Barb demonstrate how they read as partners and respond to new information. Then Barb, Anne, and Stephanie move about the room conferring with kids as they read a nonfiction article and use these strategies to enhance their understanding. The video culminates in a conversation among the three of them as they think through nonfiction instruction that supports kids as they read to learn and engage in independent research. Barb models her own research process and shares her kids' unique ways of organizing their thinking and bringing learning to life.

After fifteen years of regular elementary and special education teaching in the Jefferson County Schools in Lakewood, Colorado, Stephanie became a staff developer for the Denver-based Public Education and Business Coalition (PEBC), a partnership of leaders from education and business who support innovation in public schools. In that role, she has worked with educators throughout Colorado coordinating literacy projects, leading workshops, and conducting classroom demonstrations.

Though it is determined in this particular context that the frequencies of these devices do differ somewhat between these two populations, indexing possible differences in stancetaking and power, it is also asserted that these different frequencies may reflect variation in the concerns being discussed.

This framework considers direct relationships between teacher attributes and teacher effects; mediation, which may help explain relationships between teacher attributes and teacher effects; and contextual effects, which consider the nested nature of educational data. Using data from the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) study, I establish a sample of urban teachers from the six MET districts working in schools with at least both 60% minority and 60% low-income student populations. A multilevel structural modeling (MSEM) is employed to examine urban teacher characteristics and qualifications as predictors of teacher effects estimated using value-added modeling, with measures of pedagogical content knowledge and instructional practices as mediators. Using significant attributes resulting from MSEM analyses, I predict the impact on student learning of making specific improvements to the qualifications and characteristics of the urban teacher workforce. Findings suggest that improving instructional quality among urban teachers is likely to have the largest impact on student learning. Teachers' pedagogical content knowledge in math was also found to have significant impacts, and teachers' race is associated with student performance in English Language Arts (ELA). Contextual effects were found in ELA with schools composed of teachers with advanced degrees or higher levels of instructional quality showing positive associations with student learning. A significant mediating effect was also identified in which White teachers, as mediated by their pedagogical content knowledge, were found to have a significant positive impact on student learning in math. No evidence was found indicating that teachers' gender, advanced degree, or years of teaching experience in their district had a direct predictive relationship with student learning, in either subject. Significant teacher effects resulting from this study can be used to inform policymakers' and practitioners' urban teacher hiring, development, and evaluation decisions, understanding that recruiting teachers with higher instructional quality and math pedagogical content knowledge may be critical. Teachers' race may also be important to recognize in ELA instruction, with minority teachers being more effective, suggesting that policymakers and practitioners should find ways to attract minority teachers for ELA instruction that have high levels of instructional quality. In relation to significant contextual effects, reformers must better understand and build upon the social dynamics between teachers that share these significant attributes in urban schools as influenced by such facilitators as communities of practice and teacher leadership, and their likeliness to influence student learning. This study can also be used to guide more focused research on urban schools and teachers, specifically, and guide future studies of teacher quality, which should consider contextual and mediating effects. Policymakers can use significant findings, along with future research on urban teachers, to better select and prepare teachers for urban schools. Results from this study can inform national conversations on urban teacher and school reform, drive future research on urban teachers and schooling, and ultimately help to improve the quality of education for our students who need it most.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   A framework for teacher quality was developed to examine attributes of urban teachers in relation to their impact on student learning, understanding the role and value teachers play in improving student learning and the unique challenges of urban schools.

According to semantic bootstrapping theory, as the participant was taught the verb's meaning, he would also learn its argument requirements, which are semantic-syntactic in nature. Treatment effects, generalization to similarly and to less complex verbs, and generalization to English (L2) were measured. The participant did appear to learn the meaning of the verbs and use their optional and obligatory complex argument structures in conversational speech. There was some evidence of generalization to English, as well. However, the participant did not generalize to other Spanish verbs in probe data, likely due to the loosely constrained probes and due to argument structure being a more closely semantically-tied than syntactically-tied grammatical component. Semantic meaning does not generalize across lexical items, but rather is learned as a discrete unit.

Students in the everyday English approach condition were taught the concepts in everyday, conversational English before content-specific scientific terms were introduced, while students in the textbook approach condition were taught the same concepts and vocabulary simultaneously. The results show that the everyday English approach was significantly more effective in helping both ELLs and non-ELL students develop a coherent understanding of abstract concepts related to photosynthesis and respiration. Students in the everyday English approach condition were also better able to link content-specific terms to their understanding of the concepts. These findings show the potential advantage of using students\u2019 everyday English as a resource to make science more accessible to linguistically diverse students in mainstream classrooms.

We investigated the instructional strategies this teacher used to support her ELLs in the practices of argumentation and communication, and the ways ELLs constructed and communicated claims, evidence, and reasons in whole class and small group settings as a result. From qualitative analyses of teacher interviews, classroom interactions, and student products, we found that the teacher routinely implemented three types of instructional supports to help ELL students argue from evidence and communicate information: primary language support (although she herself was not fluent in Spanish), deliberate scaffolds, and small group instruction. Further, given these multiple opportunities for engagement, we found that ELLs experienced both successes and challenges participating in class, crafting arguments from evidence, and reading and producing written texts: While ELL students constructed aspects of arguments in small groups, the substance of their discussions was not necessarily reflected in their whole class participation or written products. Taken together, our findings emphasize the need to more closely attend to the teaching and learning of discourse in science.

Compared with the last century, we are increasingly aging and white on the one hand and young and multi-hued on the other. More and more of us were born in other nations, speak different languages, and carry different cultural traditions with us. The number of school-age children in the United States whose native language is not English is increasing. Reports on ways to accommodate these dual language learners (DLLs) cite many case studies, highlighting strategies that prove successful. In this study, the phenomenon of the whole group lesson and ways to support language learners within this context are examined. Curricular shifts and practices that make large group time more meaningful and interactive are important to accommodate both language learners and all of the learners in the group (Sancho Passe, 2013, p. 7). Over the course of the academic year, a case study of three native Russian speaking students enrolled in an English-based Montessori preschool was conducted. Observations were made of these DLL's response to and/or participation in whole group gathering, over time and given specific interventions. What we witnessed caused us to conclude that, overall, group lessons are supportive and certain strategies are more engaging than others. Not surprisingly, during periods of pure conversation the language learners all showed signs of inattentiveness. Books, songs and movement proved to be more engaging than lessons with props, except when the children were actively involved in discussion about or handling the visual aid.

Science teacher educators, in response to the NGSS, recognize that it is necessary for pre-service and in-service teachers to know more about how instructional strategies in language and science can complement one another. Our purpose in this study was to explore a model of integration that can be used in classrooms. To do this, we examined the change in science content knowledge and academic vocabulary for English language learners (ELLs) as they engaged in inquiry-based science experience utilizing the 5R Instructional Model. Two units, erosion and wind turbines, were developed using the 5R Instructional Model and taught during two different years in a summer school program for ELLs. We analyzed data from interviews to assess change in conceptual understanding and science academic vocabulary over the 60\u00a0h of instruction. The statistics show a clear trend of growth supporting our claim that ELLs did construct more sophisticated understanding of the topics and use more language to communicate their knowledge. As science teacher educators seek ways to prepare elementary teachers to help preK-12 students to learn science and develop the language of science, the 5R Instructional Model is one pathway.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   As teacher educators, we are tasked with preparing prospective teachers to enter a field that has undergone significant changes in student population and policy since we were K-12 teachers.

Opportunities to build strong research skills are critical, yet empirical research demonstrates that students from Grades K-16 struggle with inquiry tasks, particularly in online environments. There is a need to create models that will support teachers in developing students' research skills and can be used to develop reliable and valid assessments of such skills while aligning with standards. Under the CBAL\u2122 research initiative, we have developed a model of conducting research and inquiry as a key literacy practice in the English language arts (ELA). In this paper, we draw on literature from the cognitive and learning sciences\u2014including work in discourse processing, science education, educational technology, and information literacy\u2014to provide the theoretical background for this key practice. We identify a set of activities and skills that are critical for participating in research; each skill is accompanied by a set of provisional learning progressions, which outlines tentative predictions about the qualitative changes in a skill that develop over time with appropriate instruction. These learning progressions and their relation to the key practice can be leveraged in the design of cognitively based assessments of research and inquiry that are sensitive to students' developmental level. We conclude, with an example design for such an assessment to illustrate how key practices and learning progressions can be integrated to support measurement of research and inquiry skills.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   Current educational standards call for students to engage in the skills of research and inquiry, with a focus on gathering evidence from multiple information sources, evaluating the credibility of those sources, and writing an integrated synthesis that cites evidence from those sources.

It is for these purposes that the value of alternative methodologies is not situated at the margins of the rhetorical canons. Instead, it is embedded in the very core of the canons, defined as an element that works from the center, helping advance the study of rhetoric. Furthermore, strategic academic discourses that explicitly acknowledge interconnected identities and relationships offer invaluable perspectives on the productive tensions between objective and subjective approaches to historiography and archival research. Moreover, a growing number of rhetoric, writing, and technical communication scholars are writing their research stories, intentionally enriching both their processes and their outcomes in doing so. By developing an understanding of how research methodologies interact with writing regional histories and performing archival research, this study fosters current conversations in the field and advances an understanding of how research narratives enrich the rhetorical tradition.

Recent conversations - Pamela Takayoshi and Brian Huot (2003), Cynthia Selfe (2007), Joddy Murray (2009), and The National Writing Project (2010) - recognize that the presence of technology has given rise to multimodality in composition curricula. Thus, this project first questions what can be considered multimodality by examining where print and digital composing spaces have differences and similarities. Second, whether the multimodal composition process occurs in print or digital composing spaces, the process of multimodality (either instruction or production) relies on Semiotics as a basis for visual interpretation and theory. To showcase this theory in practical application, this project analyzes advertisements for technology to map society's history with various technological landmarks. Next, this project then considers how multimodality can be used in composition curriculum by exemplifying an Intermediate Writing. However, the presence of multimodality in the classroom raises the question of assessment. As a result, this project utilizes Semiotics in conjunction with theories of discourse as a foundation for assessing multimodal composition projects. Finally, this dissertation provides discussion that speculates on the future direction of composition. This speculation recognizes that the influence multimodality has is not just noticeable in popular composition textbooks.

The first four chapters consider English morphology and the recent types of word formation in English: the first introduces the morphologicalterminology used in the work and the book's theoretical perspectives; chapter 2 discusses productivity and constraints on derivations; chapter 3 describes the basic typology of English compounds; and chapter 4 considers the role of particles in word formation and recent construct types specific to English. Chapters5 and 6 focus respectively on analogical and imaginative aspects of neologistic creation and the roles of metaphor and metonymy. In chapters 7 and 8 the author considers the influence of folk etymology and tabu, and the cycle of loss of expressivity and its renewal. After outlining the phonological structure of words and its role in word abridgements, he examines the acoustic and perceptual motivation of word forms. He then devotes four chapters to aspects and functions of truncation and toreduplicative and conjunctive formations. In the final chapter he looks at the relationship between core and expressive morphology and the role of punning and other forms of language play, before summarizing his arguments and findings and setting out avenues for future research.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   English Lexicogenesis investigates the processes by which novel words are coined in English, and how they are variously discarded or adopted, and frequently then adapted.
