Results were mixed. Quantitatively, the EFL group was closer to the Control group of native speakers in their overall metadiscourse, but the ESL group was closer to the Control group in more than half of the subcategories. Qualitatively, the ESL group was closer to the Control group in four categories, which helped them to establish their ethos and logos. However, both EFL and ESL writers failed to employ other metadiscourse markers to express their attitudes clearly and engage their readers. To bridge the rhetorical gaps in L2 writing, this thesis asserts that explicit instruction in the rhetorical features of English academic writing is not only needed, but also should be required at early stages of writing instruction.

Eighty-three advanced English language learners from the American English and Culture Program at Arizona State University were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: the use of English Central with a learner-control, shared-control, and a no-treatment condition. The two treatment groups were assigned approximately 14.7 hours of online instruction. The relative impact of each of the three conditions was assessed using two measures. First, the Pearson Versant Test (www.versanttest.com), a well-established English-as-a-second-language speaking test, was administered to all of the participants as a pre- and post-test measure. Second, students were given a post-treatment questionnaire that measured their motivation in using online instruction in general, and English Central specifically. Since a significant teacher effect was found, teachers involved in this study were also interviewed in order to ascertain their attitude toward English Central as a homework tool. Learner outcomes were significantly different between the shared and learner conditions. Student motivation was predictive of learning outcomes. Subjects in the shared condition outperformed those in the learner condition. Furthermore, those in the shared condition scored higher than the control condition; however, this result did not reach statistical significance. Results of the follow-up teacher survey revealed that while a teacher's view of the tool (positive or negative), was not a predictor of student success, teacher presentation of the tool may lead to a significant impact on student learning outcomes.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   This study aims to uncover whether English Central, an online English as a Second Language tool, improves speaking proficiency for undergraduate students with developing English skills.

Nineteen Chinese teachers, who taught English as a foreign language in China, attended a short-term teacher-training program in Canada and had access to opportunities for authentic interaction with native English speakers. Another 19 Chinese EFL teachers who had never been to an English speaking country served as the comparison group. Twenty English native speakers were also recruited to provide native norms for the pragmatics assessment measures. Three research questions were addressed in this study. First, I examined what kind of interactive exposure was accessible to the study abroad teachers, and investigated what types of interactive activities might contribute to pragmatics learning. Second, I examined whether study-abroad teachers demonstrated approximation to native speaker norms with regard to requesting through two tests: a written discourse completion task (WDCT) and an appropriateness judgment task (AJT). Finally, I explored whether the study-abroad experience had increased teachers' confidence in teaching English pragmatics. The data analysis of the study-abroad teachers' logs showed that they were engaged in a much wider variety of English interactive activities than the at-home teachers. They also demonstrated a more significant growth in pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic awareness in certain situations, but failed to acquire a full range of the native-like forms. Compared with native English speakers, the Chinese teachers used similar external modifiers, but less variety in request formulae and internal modification. They did not appear to realize that some strategies and formulae are context-based and scenario-specific. However, their confidence in teaching pragmatics was enhanced. The findings show that social interaction, cultural values, pragmatic transfer, social role, and living arrangement are factors affecting L2 pragmatic acquisition in a study-abroad context. The results also reveal that it is difficult for adult L2 learners to develop native-like pragmatic competence in a naturalistic setting, due to a lack of sufficient target language exposure, corrective feedback, and explicit pragmatic instruction.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   This study is a longitudinal investigation in the effectiveness of interactive exposure on the acquisition of English requests in a study-abroad setting.

The book addresses some of these issues, arranging its 25 chapters into five sections: namely, Assessing Language Performance; Teaching English Writing; Learner Autonomy; Corpus and Discourse Research; and Learning English in East Asian Contexts.

Other chapters are on novel or lesser known topics such as non-verbal delivery in speaking assessment; the use of visualization as a reading strategy; learner strategies in a Facebook corpus; effects of discourse signaling cues and rate of speech; and an ontogenetic analysis of college English textbooks.

And we also examine the contradiction whereby many Americans revere God's work with oceans and sunsets, but think he did a lousy job on various human body parts. The book also contains a comprehensive reference section that includes: The differences in pronunciation between American-English and British-English;;Words that sound the same but are spelled differently; Words that look and sound the same, but which have different meanings from one side of the Atlantic to the other; and the biggest section of all, the \"Amglish to Britglish\" translator.\"--Amazon.com.", "sellerPrice": "$9.46", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"Among English-speaking nations, the United States of America is as insular and unique as the Earth is compared to Mars.

Plus, the workbook includes plenty of reading and writing exercises to practice and build upon what you learn.. This course is designed to cover the curriculum of a first semester college course in Spanish. Throughout the lessons, you\u2019ll explore how to learn a language and start communicating. Your teacher, world-class language instructor Professor Bill Worden of the University of Alabama, has refined this approach over more than 20 years, distilling the step-by-step system that works the best for adult learners.

Increasingly relevant in global culture and economics, it\u2019s the official language of 20 countries, plus the territory of Puerto Rico. Half a billion people speak it, including over 50 million in the U.S., and every day we encounter Spanish speakers right around the corner. For these reasons and more, Spanish is one of the most useful languages on earth..

From the beginning, you\u2019ll work with key material and concepts that help you build a fundamental \u201cfeel\u201d for the language.. The lessons begin with simple groundwork for Spanish: the proper pronunciation of consonant and vowel sounds, the alphabet, and greetings and responses to greetings. With these building blocks, you can start speaking to people in Spanish right away!. From there, you\u2019ll delve into the most important part of speech: verbs. This is anything but dry, rote repetition: you\u2019ll discover verbs through their living context, by using them in many different practical settings, getting a visceral sense of how they operate in everyday speaking, and, most importantly, experiencing how they form the basis for expressing yourself in Spanish.. By working sequentially with ser and estar\u2014the two Spanish verbs meaning \u201cto be\u201d\u2014plus vital verbs such as ir (to go), tener (to have), hacer (to make or do), and querer (to want or to love), you\u2019ll learn to talk about basic thoughts, feelings, and actions.. You\u2019ll build on the ability to express yourself with verbs through in-depth practice with the forms and uses of Spanish nouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and pronouns, and an ever-expanding vocabulary\u2014all the necessary linguistic tools that will allow you to communicate successfully in Spanish.. Enriching the language lessons, Professor Worden exposes you to the culture and ethos of the Spanish-speaking world. At key moments, you\u2019ll explore Spanish literature, soccer rivalries, family relationships, and more. You\u2019ll also learn about variations in how Spanish is spoken in different regions of the world.. Lay the Groundwork for Real Conversations. Professor Worden has structured this course to give you the ability to communicate about many kinds of practical, daily situations. Across the span of the lessons, you\u2019ll learn to negotiate common activities and concerns in Spanish through these vital subjects and forms of speech:. \u2022 Understand a full range of social greetings and expressions used in social interactions. \u2022 Learn to express time, days, and dates in Spanish, as well as to count and use numbers. \u2022 Study how to talk about emotions and mental states. \u2022 Develop vocabulary on subjects such as social life, the family, the home, food and drink, money, the Internet, travel, leisure activities, the human body, romantic relations, and more. \u2022 Study how to make useful affirmative and negative statements, and learn the rules for commands (also called imperatives), which are indispensable for everyday speech. \u2022 Learn to form interrogatives and to ask and answer questions\u2014vital skills for building conversational fluency in Spanish..

The number of school-age children in the United States whose native language is not English is increasing. Reports on ways to accommodate these dual language learners (DLLs) cite many case studies, highlighting strategies that prove successful. In this study, the phenomenon of the whole group lesson and ways to support language learners within this context are examined. Curricular shifts and practices that make large group time more meaningful and interactive are important to accommodate both language learners and all of the learners in the group (Sancho Passe, 2013, p. 7). Over the course of the academic year, a case study of three native Russian speaking students enrolled in an English-based Montessori preschool was conducted. Observations were made of these DLL's response to and/or participation in whole group gathering, over time and given specific interventions. What we witnessed caused us to conclude that, overall, group lessons are supportive and certain strategies are more engaging than others. Not surprisingly, during periods of pure conversation the language learners all showed signs of inattentiveness. Books, songs and movement proved to be more engaging than lessons with props, except when the children were actively involved in discussion about or handling the visual aid.

Despite the importance of comprehending highly sophisticated academic reading in international education, there is a lack of research in the field as to how advanced L2 readers cope with the texts with which the highly educated native speakers engage. This study, therefore, examined meaning construction processes of highly proficient L2 readers during reading the texts that vary in degree of cohesion. To describe readers' approaches to text cohesion and also recognize readers' perceptions of their own process, the study used a close observation of reading processes of nine highly proficient graduate students at a U.S. university with the use of qualitative research methods. The students participated in two interviews - pre-reading interview and post-reading cognitive interview - and two think-aloud verbal protocol sessions. Participants read one high-cohesive and one low-cohesive text during the think-aloud sessions, and then shared the meaning they constructed from the texts and also their thinking about the texts. The data from the instruments were analyzed qualitatively using a grounded theory approach. The results of the study reveal that the readers' meaning representation processes emerging as the result of reader and text interaction display differences at the local and global levels of processing of the high- and low-cohesive text.

This study examines the epistemic beliefs of English language learners, a population of learners that is relatively understudied on the topic of personal epistemology. More specifically, this qualitative study explores ELLs' dimensional and developmental epistemic beliefs about vocabulary knowledge in English. First-year international undergraduate students enrolled in remedial ESL writing courses were given a series of speaking and writing placement tests in an Intensive ESL program at a Mid-western university. Responses to writing prompts and interviews were analyzed for this study from an epistemological lens to determine the espoused epistemic beliefs of English language learners. Results suggested that many ELLs espoused advanced epistemic beliefs (i.e., evaluativism) about vocabulary knowledge most of the time. There was a general disparity found, however, with ELLs' epistemic beliefs about the source and justification of English vocabulary knowledge. That is, there was a tendency for ELLs to espouse less sophisticated epistemic beliefs (i.e., absolutism) about source and justification of vocabulary knowledge. This implies that participants' beliefs about these dimensions of knowledge and knowing might be hindering the emergence of more sophisticated epistemic beliefs in the domain of English language learning. Additional implications suggest that ESL curriculum needs to focus on developing ELLs' use of the appropriate cognitive strategies (i.e., critical thinking) to determine the most accurate sources of vocabulary knowledge in specified communicative contexts.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   There is a growing body of work that examines the epistemic beliefs of learners and the role those beliefs play in the development of their critical thinking and other cognitive processes (Hofer, 2001).

Language minority groups, particularly native Spanish speakers, are currently the fastest growing demographic in the nation. Community college English as a Second Language (ESL) courses constitute a vital support for these students by providing adult ELL students with foundational college literacy skills. With the growing demand for college graduates in today's workforce, language minority students, like their native English-speaking (NES) counterparts, need to leave college with vendible work credentials. Community colleges need practical and affordable ways to improve learning and degree completion rates of their English language learners. College ESL programs face two key challenges in realizing this goal: (1) providing quality language preparation for vii college-bound ELLs, and (2) developing efficient ways to deliver curricula to a student population that has limited financial resources and time. This was a single institution case study that investigated two ESL curriculum models at a large urban community college. The study compared the academic performance and persistence of ELL students who studied in a sheltered ESL curriculum to ELL students who studied in a concurrent enrollment ESL curriculum that combined college-level courses with advanced ESL study. The researcher analyzed student data from college archives: transcript data, admission data, and course performance results. Data from three student groups were salient to the study - students in concurrent enrollment courses (partially-mainstreamed ESL students), students in traditional ESL courses (not mainstreamed), and native English speakers in freshmen-level general education courses. The study described the relationship between the two types of ESL curriculum and the academic performance and persistence of ELL students in each program. Findings showed that advanced ELL students were able to successfully complete select college courses as they finished their ESL program. Results indicated that early access to college courses motivated students to persist.

It is so simple you can use it for last minute revision. The skills and requirements for the GCSE English language exam are very specific: retrieving information from texts, inference, analysis of language, presentational techniques and comparing texts are some of the skills needed. For writing, students are required to engage the reader and produce a response, which relates to the purpose and audience. This book teaches students how to write using different purposes - to inform, explain, argue, advise, describe, persuade, review and how to make the tone and register of their writing suitable for the audience. It emphasises the P.E.E or P.E.T.E.R technique, so students have a blue print (format) to work from; make POINT, give EVIDENCE, comment on TECHNIQUE, EFFECT and RESPONSE. This helps students to develop analytical skills for non-fiction tasks and responses in English literature papers. The students are also taught to use rhetorical techniques - groups of three, speaking directly to the reader, rhetorical questions, inclusive pronouns as well as stylistic devices like similes, metaphors and high level vocabulary. The aim of this book is: - To help every child gain a grade C in GCSE English. - To outline the requirements of the present GCSE course and to teach students to structure and organise a piece of writing - To teach students to look for key words in a task and to plan a suitable response. - To teach students to use linguistic and stylistic devices. - To show them how to use rhetorical techniques. - To teach P.E.E techniques and to teach the analytical skills required for English language and literature tasks. - To teach good spelling, punctuation and grammar.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   A clear, concise revision guide to boost your grade, written by a tutor who is familiar with the requirements of the new GCSE examination.

The volume also challenges received wisdom on the nature of slang: that it is short-lived and that slang is restricted to verbal language. With an introduction by editor Julie Coleman, the topics covered range from Inner City New York slang and Hip Hop Slang to UK student slang and slang in Scotland. Authors also explore slang in Jamaica, Australia, New Zealand, India and Hong Kong and the influence of English slang on Norwegian, Italian and Japanese.

Syntactical Mechanics systematically defines the basic categories of traditional grammar (parts of speech, subjects and predicates, and types of sentences and subordinate clauses), and then unpacks the most important syntactical structures and markings that shape meaning in a sentence. These grammatical entities evolved, McMenomy asserts, from their common Indo-European ancestors as tools for the expression of meaning, and the continuity of an idea can often be traced through these structures. Accordingly, he examines the elements of English, Latin, and Greek syntax together, exploring how their similarities and differences can disclose something of their underlying rationale. With abundant examples from English as well as Latin and Greek, McMenomy considers the grammatical cases of the noun, and the tenses, moods, and aspects of a verb.
