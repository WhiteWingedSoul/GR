A quantitative analysis of the participants' written essays, using Laufer and Nation's Lexical Frequency Profiler, explored if there were any differences in the level and sophistication of the vocabulary between essays written pre-project and essays written post-project, using the same prompts. The results revealed that extensive reading and listening throughout the project helped the participants implicitly acquire new word families and word types that belong to West's (1953) first one-thousand most common words in the English language (K1). In addition, there was a decrease in the total number of words belonging to the K1 category, as well as an increase in the total number of words that belong to Coxhead's (2000) Academic Word List (AWL) in the post-project essays.

That's why, at their worst, analogies can deceive, manipulate, or mislead us into disaster. The challenge? Spotting the difference before it's too late.

While previous studies mostly relied on a single acoustic correlate of speech rhythm, usually duration, the author proposes a multidimensional approach to the production of speech rhythm that takes into account various acoustic correlates. The results reveal that the two varieties differ with regard to a number of dimensions, such as duration, sonority, intensity, loudness, pitch, and glottal stop insertion. The second part of the study addresses the question whether the difference in speech rhythm between Indian and British English is perceptually relevant, based on intelligibility and dialect discrimination experiments.

Investigated through the experiences of young bilingual learners allows the reader to make sense of the making meaning that occurs when the child cannot make sense of his/her new?world?; nor communicate verbally in the language of instruction in the classroom. Remarkably, learning through the silent period is revealed as both complex and?messy? as the bilingual child mediates his or her own learning through a synthesis of alternative learning pathways. The silent period is presented as a crucial time for learning; distributed through a synthesis of close observation, intense listening and most significantly copying the practices of others.

English education was formally introduced in Japan for fifth and sixth graders in 2011 and is still in its infancy as a program. This study compares two groups (Grade 7 and 8) of students, one with ELES and one without, in order to shed light on their experiences. Comparisons are carried out not only quantitatively, measuring changes in English skills (listening, speaking, reading, and vocabulary / grammar) and the ELES students? affective aspects, but also qualitatively through in-depth interviews. Thus, this study attempts to capture the ELES students? experiences from a multi-dimensional perspective. The comprehensive literature review provided offers a valuable resource not only for researchers looking for a quick digest of the literature in this field before undertaking their own research, but also for policy-makers seeking to assess how to best implement ELES.", "sellerPrice": "$103.20", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   This book presents a pioneering longitudinal study on English language instruction at the elementary school (ELES) level in the Japanese public school system.

A quasiexperimental research designed was adopted. The treatment sample of this study consisted of four teachers of listening and their students (in total of 100). The study was conducted in two phases, the baseline and intervention, with the former lasting for three weeks, and the latter sustained over approximately four months. In the baseline, data of students' listening scores, since their admission to the university, and teachers' opinions about teaching listening skills and computer use were collected in the form of pre-intervention teacher questionnaires and informal conversations. In the intervention phase, the teachers were invited to a training workshop on computer skills, and received weekly coaching sessions on selecting and using online resources for listening instruction in class. The intervention classes were taught with these supplementary online resources while the comparison classes (the other four classes) were taught in the traditional way (i.e. listening classes were supplemented with extra listening books selected by their teachers). Comparisons in terms of students' listening performance were made between the two groups. Data from the baseline and intervention showed that the students in the intervention classes performed better in terms of language-related skills and listening skills than the comparison students. Both the intervention students and their teachers were highly motivated and had positive attitudes toward computer use in listening classes. Besides that, the students in the intervention classes were observed to have increased their autonomy. In addition, the intervention teachers became more confident in using computers and gained better skills in selecting effective sources from the Internet for listening instruction. The study suggests that computer use in listening instruction should be given much more consideration so as to increase the listening skills, motivation and learner autonomy of EFL students, as well as to enhance motivation and computer self-efficacy of EFL teachers in Vietnamese tertiary institutions.

The classroom teachers are responsible for the planning, implementation and development of skills the students need in order to reach the National Standard level for writing. This pilot study investigates the integration of the focussed listening to music in the creative writing lessons for a group of nine Year Four children in a decile three school using a multi-modal pedagogy developed by the researcher. It is based on a case study by Trinick (2010) in a decile eight school and has been adapted to suit the learning needs of the students in a decile three school using the action research process. All data for this research was collated over a series of fourteen lessons in an eight week period and examined using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to analyse and identify each student's 'experiencing' and 'realisations' of the music. Socio-cultural influences in the lives of the children impact on the language and ideas they bring into the classroom, and the Discourses used in their writing. The theories of Universal Grammar and Universal Musical Grammar will be discussed to help connect the children's work as being meaningful and not made up. Therefore research on the innate neural resources of the default mode network and working memory of each student will also be incorporated to align their brainstormed ideas and creative thinking with the gap between their 'realised' ideas and creative writing. The three pieces of music played will be harmonically analysed in order to match the composers' intent for their music with the creative writing produced by the children. The findings of this pilot study suggests that the children's responses (e.g., oral, visual, visceral) are not necessarily reflected in the way the National Standards are written and therefore, teacher judgement is rendered even harder to make.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   Increasing pressure is put on learners in the New Zealand education system to reach identified bench marks in their writing.

Findings indicate that after the metacognitive strategy session: learners were able to effectively use the TED Talk videos to increase understanding of a listening text; learners' metacognitive awareness was raised; and learners reported that the training session helped them to better understand how to improve their listening skills in a self-directed learning environment.

This study investigates the effects of subtitled TV series on Chinese EFL learners' listening comprehension. Eighty students in a Chinese university participated. Students were divided into four groups based on their grade level, with twenty in each group. The four groups were two classes of 1st year undergraduates, one class of 3rd year undergraduates, and one class of graduate students, all at the same Chinese university. Each group watched four video clips with three subtitled treatments: L1 Chinese, L2 English, dual (L1 and L2). There was also a control video with no subtitles. The video clips, their treatments, and the order in which the students watched them, were all counterbalanced using Latin Squares. After watching each video, students did a vocabulary and a comprehension test.

This qualitative study asked three major question: How does listening to educational radio programs impact English learners; language skills, How does listening to educational radio programs impact English language learners; comprehension skills, and What kind of educational radio topics do English language learners prefer and why?In order to answer the research questions, a listening practice session with comprehension questions and interviews was designed to ask six international students' preferences in using educational radio programs on the NPR station as a listening tool. The data was collected during the listening practice session, comprehensive question, and interview. The interviews responses were analyzed using coding methods described by Erickson (1986).The findings demonstrate that listening to educational radio programs positively impacts English learners language skills. It influences participants listening to English words and sentences; learners can train their ears to listen to and understand fast speakers. One of the major findings of this study is that participants feel that there is no gap between the English they listento on the radio and the actual English they encounter in their daily lives as they communicate with native English speakers or listen to lectures and different forms of mass media. The study results suggest that the radio can be an educational tool that promotes second language learning, regardless of the native language or the language one wants to learn.

Effective pronunciation skills are necessary for successful communication and as such can greatly impact one's personal, social, and professional life. Studying the use of songs for teaching pronunciation is interesting because as a linguistically rich material, songs can enhance learning due to their positive affective, social, and cognitive influence in the L2 classroom. Using songs to teach pronunciation within a Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) framework constitutes a novel approach to an underexplored area of classroom research. In order to learn how using songs might help native Spanish speakers learn English suprasegmentals, I conducted a mixed methods exploratory short-term case study of Chilean university students studying English Language and Literature at the Universidad Cato\u0301lica de Chile. Using three groups: a control, songs, and no-songs group, the pre- to post-course progress was measured first with the two treatment groups combined and then with them separated. In this way we were able to measure the effectiveness of songs compared to other materials as well as to no intervention whatsoever. After two weeks of instruction, we found that using songs can significantly help in the production of the schwa when reading a text and of thought groups when speaking freely. Results obtained in listening tests were not statistically significant. However, closer examination of the performance of individual songs- group participants showed not only a greater than average progress in different suprasegmental areas in both listening and speaking, but also an appreciation of songs as an effective and enjoyable means of learning pronunciation. It would be advantageous for future research to explore the effects of teaching the pronunciation areas using the same methodology but for longer periods of time with delayed post-course testing to determine whether the effects are long-term. In addition, further exploration into the relationship between pronunciation perception and production could provide insight for the development of more effective teaching techniques.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   In this thesis, I set out to investigate whether the use of songs can help L2 speakers learn to better perceive and produce suprasegmental phenomena.

According to one position recasts are effective because they provide learners with both negative and positive evidence. However, according to another position they are ineffective because they frequently fail to push learners to correct their own errors. SLA researchers have also disputed the value of recasts on the grounds that they constitute an implicit type of corrective feedback that learners fail to attend to. However, as other researchers have pointed out, recasts are not invariably implicit; in many cases their corrective force is transparent. This thesis compared the effects of corrective recasts (i.e. repetition plus recasting with stress) that are relatively explicit and implicit recasts (i.e. simple recasting) on the acquisition of two English grammatical structures (3rd person -s and embedded questions). The effects of these two types of recasts were examined in terms of both learners' acquisition of implicit knowledge (measured by means of elicited imitation and oral production) and their acquisition of explicit knowledge (measured by means of written production and an untimed grammaticality judgment test). It also investigated the role of uptake-with-repair and working memory in recasts-driven L2 learning. This was a classroom-based quasi-experimental study, with four groups of EFL learners (n = 109) in a Chinese university (i.e. a corrective recast group, an implicit recast group, a task control group, and a test control group). All groups completed a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a delayed posttest. The treatment for the experimental groups consisted of corrective feedback (i.e. corrective recasts and implicit recasts) provided online while the learners performed focused tasks designed to provide contexts for the use of the target structure. The task-based lessons were audio-recorded and transcribed, enabling all occasions where uptake occurred following corrective feedback to be noted. All groups also completed working memory tests. Language knowledge scores were compared by means of parametric/non-parametric ANOVAs or ANCOVAs to examine the effect of feedback. Correlational analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between repair rate, knowledge gains and working memory capacity. Simply performing the tasks without any feedback benefited L2 acquisition, as shown by the fact that the task control group outperformed the test control group in gains in both implicit and explicit knowledge with a large effect size. Corrective recasts facilitated the development of implicit and explicit knowledge but implicit recasts only led to significant gains in explicit knowledge. Corrective recasts were more effective than implicit recasts on the implicit knowledge of embedded questions and the explicit knowledge of 3rd person -s. These results suggest that explicitness in recasts makes a difference to their efficacy, and the superior effect of corrective recasts over implicit recasts on the development of implicit or explicit knowledge depends on the target structure. This relative effect on explicit knowledge was evident for those learners who had low prior knowledge of the target structure, pointing to the mediation of learner proficiency. The repair rate was also higher after corrective recasts than implicit recasts. However, whether repair did or did not occur was found to be generally irrelevant to L2 learning through recasts. Neither phonological short-term memory (tapped by a non-word span test) nor complex working memory (tapped by a listening span test) was, by and large, a decisive factor in recasts-driven L2 learning in this classroom-based study. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and pedagogical implications of the study. I propose that in the context of Chinese university classroom L2 acquisition can be best promoted by means of focused tasks and corrective feedback consisting of explicit recasts, for low proficiency learners in particular.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   The efficacy of recasts  - a strategy for providing corrective feedback - is a matter of controversy in the field of second language acquisition (SLA).

Non-native sound contrast perception depends on a given sound\u2019s similarity or dissimilarity to the listener\u2019s equivalent native language sound. The Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) posits that it is difficult to distinguish non-native sounds when they are perceived as very similar to native sounds and are thus assimilated to a native sound category, but identification is easier when the non-native is sound is dissimilar to a native sound (Best, 1994a). The present study investigated whether native speakers of American English would display very good discrimination of /q/ in the Arabic /q/-/k/ contrast as predicted by the PAM. The Speech Learning Model (SLM) posits that non-native perception is position-sensitive and hypothesizes that the listener\u2019s perception of non-native sounds would vary from one position to another (Flege, 1995). The current study also aimed to investigate whether the discrimination of the Arabic /q/-/k/ contrast would be position-sensitive. The current study also investigated the effect of the vocalic context on the discrimination of /q/. Participants consisted of 22 (6 male and 16 female) native speakers of American English who were students or faculty members at Southern Illinois University. Their ages ranged between 19 and over 50. The data were collected through an online AXB discrimination task survey. Target sounds were represented in 108 pseudowords so that the sounds could be contrasted in minimal pairs. The environments were word-initially followed by /i/, /u/, and /a/; word-medially, between two instances of /i/, two instances of /u/, and two instances of /a/; and word-finally, preceded by /i/, /u/, and /a/. Two pseudoword pairs were selected for each contrast. Four AXB combinations (AAB, ABB, BAA, and BBA) were generated for each of the nine contrasts, which resulted in a total of 36 stimuli. The participants were requested to click on a button to listen to the recordings of these word pairs and check the right answer. The findings were consistent with predictions made by PAM that native speakers of American English would have a very good discrimination of /q/ in the Arabic /q/-/k/ contrast. The results suggested that the uncategorized versus categorized (UC) type could also be of excellent discriminability. SLM was not totally supported because the differences were not statistically significant. However, the data indicated that some positions resulted in better discrimination scores than other positions and that certain vowels likewise resulted in better vocalic discrimination scores.

This dissertation examined how listeners represent and process nonnative speech. Study 1 investigated the salient perceptual dimensions of nonnative speech for native listeners using a free classification task. Accent strength was a highly salient feature of nonnative speech across multiple stimulus sets. Accent strength remained a salient organizational schema even when listeners were instructed to classify talkers by native language background. To examine the effects of familiarity with different accents on nonnative speech perception, Study 2 tested native English, Korean, and Spanish listeners' classification of native and nonnative talkers. These listener groups performed similarly in overall classification accuracy and demonstrated heightened perceptual sensitivity to talkers with whom they shared a native language. An accent discrimination task was employed in Study 3 to examine the process by which listeners differentiate one accent from another. Native listeners were sensitive to the differences between two nonnative accents, albeit to a significantly lesser degree than to the difference between native and nonnative accents. Sensitivity levels also differed across accent pairs and stimulus types. Finally, the relationship between listeners' accent representation and accented-speech understanding was assessed in Study 4, using accent categorization and nonnative speech-in-noise transcription tasks. Listeners' accent categorization performance predicted their transcription performance. Listeners' foreign language study experiences predicted their accent categorization performance, but not their transcription performance. More variable linguistic experiences, such as those gained through foreign language study, may lead listeners to have better-specified nonnative accent categories; however, those same experiences do not improve their accented speech understanding. Together, these studies suggest that listeners' perception of nonnative accents is organized along a graded scale of perceptual similarity to the listeners' own accent, as well as to the accent in their environment. Listeners' linguistic environments and experiences, therefore, are central to shaping their representations of nonnative accents.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   Nonnative speech is a naturalistic source of speech variation that is relatively familiar to listeners while posing significant perceptual challenges.

I conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of a new state-led initiative in Massachusetts implemented at twelve sites during the summer of 2013. The initiative's goal was to improve educational outcomes for ELLs by increasing instructional time through intensive summer programs. I investigated three of the twelve sites for this study. The key aims of this evaluation are both summative and formative; that is, they contribute both to decisions about program continuation and program improvement (Worthen, 1990; Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). The study accomplishes these aims in two ways: 1) it provides a preliminary quantitative analysis of the potential for supplemental programs to improve the language skills of ELLs, and 2) it offers lessons, based on participants' input, on effective design features and implementation caveats for creating similar programs. I used pre- and post-test data to examine changes in reading and listening skills for students who participated in the program (n=304). My analysis showed that providing a mix of academic instruction and enrichment activities appears to be effective in diminishing summer learning loss. I found that the majority of the students in the study maintained or increased their initial language levels in reading and listening between the beginning and end of the program. While my research design was limited by the lack of a comparison group and by students' self-selection into the program, other research showing that ELLs generally lose language skills during the summer provides a basis for viewing these results as promising.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : English", "summary": "\r\n   Educators and policy makers continue to look for effective ways to address the chronically poor performance of students who are classified as English language learners (ELLS; Fry, 2008).

A Likert scale survey was conducted on the 40 participants to investigate the students' attitudes toward learning collocations. The results of the t-test indicated that the group of learners who learned collocations explicitly significantly improved their receptive and productive knowledge of the verb + noun collocations.

The instrument contained 30 English monosyllabic minimal pairs of the type CVC. The participants, who were living in the US, consisted of two groups: 5 advanced Saudi ESL learners with linguistic knowledge and 10 advanced Saudi ESL learners without linguistic knowledge. Results showed that both groups of participants (those with linguistics background and those without linguistics background) were fairly accurate at predicting final voiceless Coronal and Dorsal stops after a shorter vowel. On the other hand, they both had equal difficulties predicting voiced stops in this environment. This would explain why participants in both groups overall seemed to be listening for the voicing status of the final stop and disregarding differences in vowel length as a predictor of that voicing. Individual participants, overall, were quite uniform in their responses regardless of any background in linguistics. This finding suggests that participants in both groups relied much more on the actual voicing of the final stops than they did on the length of the preceding vowel.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File, Archival Material", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   The current study tests the use of vowel duration as a cue for the voicing of the following stop by Saudi ESL learners.

A large and growing body of literature has revealed the negative effects of various accents as impairment to the ASR performance. Although English accents have been the most studied accent varieties insofar as it is regarded the most important and prestigious international language, Malaysian English (MalE) which signifies a new variety within New Englishes of non-native speakers is still unexplored. In the ASR market product nowadays, conventional way is to treat MalE as a uniform variety despite this notion is disputed by many scholars and researchers who regard MalE as implication of localized ethnic speech diversity. Past perceptual studies have reported high possibility of detecting ethnic identities from Singapore English (SgE) and Brunei English (BruE) speech as appropriate comparator varieties to MalE accents using listening test setup. At present, no research has been done to identify ethnic origin from speech samples of MalE accented speech using multiple speech analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms for automatic classification for more reliable, standard and accurate experimental methods. This study is an attempt to fill that gap and for this purpose, a new database of MalE accents has been developed. The study elicits speech in isolated-words and continuous speech from university students of both genders of three main ethnics to represent educated speakers of Malay, Chinese and Indian groups using selected accent-sensitive words from previous studies.
