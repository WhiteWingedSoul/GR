The results provide a panoramic view of college writing in the United States. Melzer's framework begins with the rhetorical situations of the assignments--the purposes and audiences--and broadens to include the assignments' genres and discourse community contexts. Among his conclusions is that courses connected to a writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) initiative ask students to write more often, in a greater variety of genres, and for a greater variety of purposes and audiences than non-WAC courses do, making a compelling case for the influence of the WAC movement. Melzer's work also reveals patterns in the rhetorical situations, genres, and discourse communities of college writing in the United States. These larger patterns are of interest to WAC practitioners working with faculty across disciplines, to writing center coordinators and tutors working with students who bring assignments from a variety of fields, to composition program administrators, to first-year writing instructors interested in preparing students for college writing, and to high school teachers attempting to bridge the gap between high school and college writing\"--", "sellerPrice": "$24.95", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"In Assignments across the Curriculum, Dan Melzer analyzes the rhetorical features and genres of writing assignments through the writing-to-learn and writing-in-the-disciplines perspectives.

It gradually increases the level of challenge so that by the end of the book students can use appropriate grammatical structures to express more complex academic ideas. The nine units are based on the following topics: * Starting out * Information flow within a text * Looking back (past simple and present perfect) * Showing logical links (1) * Showing logical links (2) * Expressing shades of meaning * Expressing condition * Avoiding person-based writing * Using relative clauses Each unit is divided into three stages, moving from basic structures to more complex ones. Full explanations and examples are followed by extensive practice exercises. Many exercises use examples from student essays, so students can identify typical problems and work out how to put them right.

I conducted student surveys twice during the semester to gather student feedback; I also interviewed the instructors near the end of the course to gain additional input.

It asks students to write about, reflect on, and discuss the ideas, opinions, and questions that may arise from the reading.

This allows students to focus and learn contextualized vocabulary, and not to become overwhelmed; In exercises A & D throughout the workbook, the correct vocabulary item fits grammatically into exactly what is underlined; Vocabulary builds consecutively in the workbook. A word defined in an earlier chapter may be used later in a definition. Students are thereby given more opportunities to learn and recognize the new vocabulary; In the Word Builder section, sometimes grammar is introduced that is more advanced than the level.

Popchock (1999) wrote about workplace English and included several Vietnamese working in a local company where she offered English instruction, and more recently she developed a community-based literacy project and taught it at several levels to foster community engagement and English. Nardecchia (2002) presented a longitudinal single case study of a Russian immigrant working in a boat factory and trying to acquire English in the workplace with some occasional classes at the adult learning center where she was teaching. Roberton (2009) presented the Spokane VESL programs, including interviews with instructors, while Black (2013) focused her research on preliterate adult refugees and the challenges they face in the United States as they try to find employment. A major question being asked in recent research is whether English literacy is liberating or colonizing learners (MacDonald, 2015). As a proponent of democratic education, the thesis writer discusses the role of critical consciousness as well as the purposes of job training, which some would view as filling slots in industry. Democratic education should free learners from constraints related to country of origin, ethnic identity, socioeconomic status, educational level, religion, gender, and age. ABE and VESL would ideally offer job opportunities and freedom of choice to learners. Democratic education transforms a learner into an active participant who has a sharp sense of self-awareness and social responsibility. The author reviews literature about the role of literacy in learners' lives while exploring bell hooks' and Paulo Freire's definitions of emancipatory education that lays a foundation for self-actualization where full participation in a democracy would help workers not feel like machines. He argues that the ESL classroom should be a site of resistance, and the author discusses his own experiences in culinary arts vocational program.

The problem investigated is high remediation in college writing. The purpose is to identify secondary/post-secondary writing instructors\u2019 perceptions of collaboration and the impact of collaboration on college readiness. Research indicates high rates of students taking remedial writing in college (EPIC, 2013; Maeroff, Callan, & Usdan, 2001; Karp, 2012; Cates & Schaefle, 2011; Alber & Nelson, 2010; Edmunds, 2012; Kirst & Venzia, 2004), yet there were few opportunities for collaboration to address this problem. Some have argued that partnerships may rectify the readiness gap (Kirst & Venzia, 2004; National Center for Public Policy and High Education, AASCU). This study was guided by these research questions: 1. How does collaboration between higher education and secondary school teachers impact secondary school teachers\u2019 instruction and their students' college readiness as perceived by the partnering higher education and secondary school teachers across three programs? 2. What are the experiences of secondary and post-secondary writing instructors who have engaged in collaboration? 3. How can such collaboration impact students\u2019 college readiness, as perceived by instructors at each level? This was a qualitative, multi-site case study based on Malcolm Knowles\u2019 adult learning theory. It involved interviewing eighteen participants representing six secondary and five post-secondary institutions. Themes from research included perception of impact on students\u2019 college readiness, instructors\u2019 desire for collaboration, and interactions across levels to focus on common goals of college readiness. Findings showed positive perceptions, but more research is warranted to clarify the longitudinal impact of collaboration on students\u2019 college writing readiness.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   This study explores perceptions of college readiness by secondary and post-secondary instructors.

Additionally, identification of strengths and weaknesses in writing was pursued as a means of assisting writing centers to create effective writing programs in postsecondary institutions for students who experience difficulty in writing. Self-identified students with disabilities were appropriate participants for this study because these particular students have an awareness of their disability, their academic needs, and their areas of strengths and weaknesses in various disciplines. Areas identified by the sample size may be applied to other students who experience difficulty in writing within the institution. In order to recognize factors contributing to motivation and identification, a literature review was conducted to evaluate components of common practices in the postsecondary writing process. Components included (a) identifying disabilities, (b) defining self-identification, and (c) defining self-determination. Additionally, understanding the various academic support services available to students was acknowledged, particularly disabilities service centers and writing centers. To understand the academic process of postsecondary basic writers and the cause of the disconnect between secondary and postsecondary writing curriculums, a definition of underprepared students needed to be established. Similarly, descriptions of poor writing skills, secondary education writing scores, and common writing challenges were evaluated. Qualitative research methods were used through semi-structured interviews to obtain information regarding participant experiences. Themes emerged from findings and included (a) goal orientation, (b) identification of postsecondary writing expectations, (c) self-awareness of strengths and weaknesses, and (d) motivational factors contributing to academic success.

This study examines the epistemic beliefs of English language learners, a population of learners that is relatively understudied on the topic of personal epistemology. More specifically, this qualitative study explores ELLs' dimensional and developmental epistemic beliefs about vocabulary knowledge in English. First-year international undergraduate students enrolled in remedial ESL writing courses were given a series of speaking and writing placement tests in an Intensive ESL program at a Mid-western university. Responses to writing prompts and interviews were analyzed for this study from an epistemological lens to determine the espoused epistemic beliefs of English language learners. Results suggested that many ELLs espoused advanced epistemic beliefs (i.e., evaluativism) about vocabulary knowledge most of the time. There was a general disparity found, however, with ELLs' epistemic beliefs about the source and justification of English vocabulary knowledge. That is, there was a tendency for ELLs to espouse less sophisticated epistemic beliefs (i.e., absolutism) about source and justification of vocabulary knowledge. This implies that participants' beliefs about these dimensions of knowledge and knowing might be hindering the emergence of more sophisticated epistemic beliefs in the domain of English language learning. Additional implications suggest that ESL curriculum needs to focus on developing ELLs' use of the appropriate cognitive strategies (i.e., critical thinking) to determine the most accurate sources of vocabulary knowledge in specified communicative contexts.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   There is a growing body of work that examines the epistemic beliefs of learners and the role those beliefs play in the development of their critical thinking and other cognitive processes (Hofer, 2001).

Southern culture is defined as phenomena which shape the regional experience and resonate through the lives of individuals native to the US South. Participants in the study that was conducted in Chattanooga, Tennessee consisted of two current English administrators, four current English professors, eight composition students who participated in the Writers@Work program, and two visiting Southern authors whose works were used as the common texts for the Writers@Work program for two academic years. Data collection was conducted through one focus group, interviews, and textual analysis of the Writers@Work common texts used during the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 academic years. Data analysis was performed ontologically (Creswell, 2013) using phenomenological reflection (van Manen, 1990) and thematic analysis (Ayers, 2008; van Manen, 1990). The results of this phenomenological qualitative study show the Writers@Work program provides greater depth of materials and a more meaningful learning experience for students by combining Southern literature with composition studies.

However, both EFL and ESL writers failed to employ other metadiscourse markers to express their attitudes clearly and engage their readers.

It is for these purposes that the value of alternative methodologies is not situated at the margins of the rhetorical canons. Instead, it is embedded in the very core of the canons, defined as an element that works from the center, helping advance the study of rhetoric. Furthermore, strategic academic discourses that explicitly acknowledge interconnected identities and relationships offer invaluable perspectives on the productive tensions between objective and subjective approaches to historiography and archival research. Moreover, a growing number of rhetoric, writing, and technical communication scholars are writing their research stories, intentionally enriching both their processes and their outcomes in doing so. By developing an understanding of how research methodologies interact with writing regional histories and performing archival research, this study fosters current conversations in the field and advances an understanding of how research narratives enrich the rhetorical tradition.

Have they almost given up on writing? Do they reach for the tissue box when you say, \"Write an essay\"? Do you worry they won't be ready for high school or college writing? Do they say they think of things to write but can't write them down? This 2ND EDITION includes proofreading marks and exercises, a new chapter on common grammar mistakes, and numbered lessons to easily keep track of daily lessons. This course teaches your teens what they need to know for high school and will be prepare them for college writing: persuasion, compare-and-contrast essays, literary analysis, a research paper with MLA documentation, and much more. In addition, students will learn how to write description and narration essays. Beginning writers will feel safe, and advanced writers will enjoy Digging Deeper lessons. Written by the same author who wrote JUMP IN, Apologia's popular middle school writing curriculum, this course is the natural next step for those who value college-preparatory material presented in incremental steps with a conversational tone. Sharon Watson has the knack of teaching students with no prior writing experience in the same class with advanced writers. She knows when to introduce new material and how to keep it interesting. Both reluctant and eager writers will benefit from the way she reveals exactly how the \"magic trick\" of writing is done!

In response to the multiplicity, this dissertation explores personal and academic experiences to expose my own development of an L2 learner, in transcultural, translingual, and transnational identity formation and construction, via the learning and teaching of a second language. The methodology I have chosen to use is autoethnography, a relatively new momentum-gaining research tool that combines characteristics of ethnography and autobiography in the latter part of the twentieth century. It is very useful in writing about the dialectical personal and professional creative experiences of fixity and fluidity because, in autoethnographic writing, the observer and observed, the researcher and the researched, the emic and the etic, or the insider and the outsider, are the same. The central issue in this dissertation lies in three questions: In what ways has a person with a Chinese cultural background formed his thoughts and ideas about his English language learning and teaching experiences via exposure to English as a linguistic system and culture? How have the said thoughts and ideas influenced how he performs or reveals his learning and teaching experiences? In what ways can the efficiency of learning an additional language be reached or at least improved based on the dyadic relation between a first language and a second language? The transcultural, translingual and transnational adjustment to a foreign culture in keeping my growth in academia, started with an aim to understand changes in human nature wired by culture and language. Such life-altering cultural and linguistic changes forced the formation and construction of an identity to speed up with presentable performances. By using reflective and available tools for thinking, the speed of gaining quality performance can be efficiently reached. Thus, this research endeavours to provide a model for the development of a critically self-reflexive tool for thinking, so that a second or additional language, and the superstructure of a cultural identity that changes with a new culture, can be organically advanced with synergy and efficiency.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : Biography : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   The plethora of research on ESL, L1, L2 and ethnography has left under-reported autoethnographies borrowing mathematics as a tool for thinking.

In addition, while the bulk of the existing studies concerned L2 learners\u2019 incidental learning of the linguistic structures they had difficulty with during their collaboration on communicative tasks (e.g., Watanabe & Swain, 2007), little is known about the connection between collaborative dialogue and second language acquisition (SLA) when L2 learners are faced with preselected language features that are intended for learning. Furthermore, L2 learners\u2019 perspectives on collaborative dialogue and its contribution to L2 growth were for the most part ignored in the literature. This study seeks to address these gaps through the examination of English as a Second Language (ESL) learners\u2019 collaboration on English idioms that are frequently used in academic discourse. Drawing on sociocultural SLA (Lantolf, 2000; Lantolf & Thorne, 2006) and the concept of \u201clanguaging\u201d (Swain, 2006), it explores how episodes of collaborative dialogue are carried out during SCMC-based dyadic interaction, its association with SLA, and L2 learners\u2019 opinions about its effectiveness. Sixteen intermediate learners of English as a Second language (ESL) enrolled in a college-level academic writing class participated in the current study. They filled out a questionnaire, collaborated on four English idiom learning tasks, completed a pretest and posttests, wrote reflective journals, reflected on their interaction in stimulated recalls, and responded to survey and interview questions.

Thus, this project first questions what can be considered multimodality by examining where print and digital composing spaces have differences and similarities. Second, whether the multimodal composition process occurs in print or digital composing spaces, the process of multimodality (either instruction or production) relies on Semiotics as a basis for visual interpretation and theory. To showcase this theory in practical application, this project analyzes advertisements for technology to map society's history with various technological landmarks. Next, this project then considers how multimodality can be used in composition curriculum by exemplifying an Intermediate Writing. However, the presence of multimodality in the classroom raises the question of assessment. As a result, this project utilizes Semiotics in conjunction with theories of discourse as a foundation for assessing multimodal composition projects.

{"genre_form": "Case studies", "publisher": "Toledo, Ohio : University of Toledo, 2015.", "onlineName": "rave.ohiolink.edu", "description": "1 online resource (xiii, 169 pages) : illustrations", "name": "How knowledge and attitude affect ESL students' collaborative writing outcomes", "author": "Wenting Chen", "abstract": "\n           What does collaborative writing (CW) mean when we teach writing for those students who use English as a second language (ESL)? By general definition, collaborative writing means that two, or more than two, ESL students work together on their writing assignment. Research on the implementation of CW in second language (L2) writing has been discussed and reported for decades (e.g., Conner & Asenavage, 1994 Dobao, 2012; Parks, 2000; Shehadeh, 2011; Shi, 1998; Storch, 2005; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2011). Many factors that might affect CW performance have been discussed in primary studies, e.g., group size, teacher influence, student language proficiency, etc. However, most of these were external factors. Very little attention has been paid to research on student factors (internal factors\u2014e.g., cognitive knowledge or attitude) that may affect CW outcomes. In other words, whether the effectiveness of CW is caused by a teacher's beliefs and pedagogical approach for CW or some internal factors of students, i.e., students' attitudes toward CW; students' knowledge levels about CW; pre-existing preferences regarding teamwork, or a student's English proficiency, etc.) is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine how internal factors affected CW outcomes, and thereby suggest what instructors should be aware of when adopting CW in intermediate ESL classroom. Therefore, this paper addressed three important questions: 1. To what extent does students' knowledge level about CW affect ESL students' actual performance of CW? 2. To what extent does students' knowledge level about CW play a role in their positive attitudes toward CW? 3. What does CW look like in an intermediate level ESL class? A case study to compare CW experiences between two classes (n= 26) was undertaken to address these three questions. Using a mixed-method case-study approach, students (n = 26) in two classrooms were observed throughout a 7-week intermediate level English language class for university students whose native languages are not English. Participants included students from different countries (Saudi Arabia, South Korea, China, Lebanon, and South Africa) and who ranged in age from 18 to 33. In one classroom CW was introduced and practiced with research-based evidence of its efficacy explicitly explained (explicit CW class). In the other class, CW was introduced and practiced, but not explained in the same manner (implicit CW class). The major findings of the present study can be summarized as follows: First, by the end of the seven weeks, the explicit CW group had much better knowledge of CW and performed better than the second (implicit CW) class of students in terms of writing content, organization, and grammar, but there were no substantial differences in terms of vocabulary or mechanics. Second, both quantitative and qualitative findings showed that participants' knowledge about CW was independent of their attitudes toward CW. Statistically none of the correlations between these were significant. In other words, knowledge about CW did not play a very important role in their preference for CW. Additionally, through creating class participant profiles, examining transcripts of collaborative writing sessions and conducting follow up interviews, it was found that often the most proficient writers had the least preference for CW even while they acknowledged its effectiveness. Implications and limitations of this study in addition to recommendations for additional investigations in this area are also discussed.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   What does collaborative writing (CW) mean when we teach writing for those students who use English as a second language (ESL)?

In his essay, Truscott argued that empirical research, second language acquisition (SLA) theory, and practical concerns show written grammar correction (WCF) in the L2 writing classroom to be both 'ineffective' and 'harmful, ' and that, therefore, it 'should be abandoned' (p. 327). Since the time that Truscott originally expressed his concerns, much recent SLA theory and empirical research have indicated the potential efficacy of written corrective feedback (hereafter referred to as WCF) in the L2 writing classroom, and have suggested that, if undertaken prudently, WCF may not entail many of the harmful side-effects theorized by Truscott. Much of the research methodology employed in these studies remains controversial, however. Yet, while the relative effectiveness of various forms of WCF are still uncertain, WCF can and should play a limited role in the L2 writing classroom. How this limited role should be undertaken depends on many factors, but the age of the students, the second language proficiency level of the students, and the country in which the students are studying are all of significance. This thesis emphasizes the distinctions between a university level English as a Second Language (ESL) writing classroom and a university level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing classroom. This thesis also recognizes a distinction between WCF aimed at grammatical accuracy improvement and WCF aimed at idiomatic usage, such as word order and word choice, recommending the former and cautioning against the latter. This thesis recognizes that the amount and type of WCF should be manageable for the teacher and self-empowering for the student. This thesis recognizes that written grammatical accuracy improvement should not be the primary objective of the L2 writing class, but can and should play an effective minor role. This thesis advocates Minimal Marking as an effective WCF technique for the advanced proficiency L2 writing classroom and Modified Minimal Marking as an effective WCF technique for the intermediate proficiency L2 writing classroom\"--Leaves iv-v.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File, Archival Material", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   \"In 1996, a highly influential essay entitled 'The Case against Grammar Correction in L2 Writing Class', by John Truscott of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, appeared in the June edition of Language Learning.

It is so simple you can use it for last minute revision. The skills and requirements for the GCSE English language exam are very specific: retrieving information from texts, inference, analysis of language, presentational techniques and comparing texts are some of the skills needed. For writing, students are required to engage the reader and produce a response, which relates to the purpose and audience. This book teaches students how to write using different purposes - to inform, explain, argue, advise, describe, persuade, review and how to make the tone and register of their writing suitable for the audience. It emphasises the P.E.E or P.E.T.E.R technique, so students have a blue print (format) to work from; make POINT, give EVIDENCE, comment on TECHNIQUE, EFFECT and RESPONSE. This helps students to develop analytical skills for non-fiction tasks and responses in English literature papers. The students are also taught to use rhetorical techniques - groups of three, speaking directly to the reader, rhetorical questions, inclusive pronouns as well as stylistic devices like similes, metaphors and high level vocabulary. The aim of this book is: - To help every child gain a grade C in GCSE English. - To outline the requirements of the present GCSE course and to teach students to structure and organise a piece of writing - To teach students to look for key words in a task and to plan a suitable response. - To teach students to use linguistic and stylistic devices. - To show them how to use rhetorical techniques. - To teach P.E.E techniques and to teach the analytical skills required for English language and literature tasks. - To teach good spelling, punctuation and grammar.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   A clear, concise revision guide to boost your grade, written by a tutor who is familiar with the requirements of the new GCSE examination.

Looking beyond basic definitions or explanations, they explore the multiple layers of meaning within the terms that writing scholars currently use, exchange, and question. Each term featured is a part of the general disciplinary parlance, and each is a highly contested focal point of significant debates about matters of power, identity, and values. Each essay begins with the assumption that its central term is important precisely because its meaning is open and multiplex.
