The book also directs student participation and discourse. Each reading is followed by comments and guides to help focus conversation. Research has long shown that increasing a student?s metalinguistic awareness improves a student?s writing. No other reader available at this time explores the idea of multiple rhetorics or encourages their use, making A Language and Power Reader a welcome addition to writing classrooms.", "sellerPrice": "$29.95", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   Language and Power Reader organizes reading and writing activities for undergraduate students, guiding them in the exploration of racism and cross-racial rhetorics.

In the sciences, there are at least three characteristics that create the necessity to approach vocabulary differently; the novelty of the concepts the vocabulary represents to students, the inordinate amount of new words encountered in the sciences, and the lack of explicit vocabulary acquisition instruction provided by science teachers. If students were able to leverage their understanding of words and word meanings and improve their automaticity of understanding the morphology of words, they may be able to improve their overall comprehension of text as well as concepts. The Matthew Effect and the Reciprocal Model both underscore the causal nature of the vocabulary-reading comprehension relationship. They also support the sense of immediacy necessary to keep children from falling further and further behind their peers. It is possible, even at the intermediate level, to enhance a student's reading comprehension skills and content area conceptual understandings through direct vocabulary study. This study documents the benefits of using Greek and Latin word parts in ELA to acquire vocabulary and understand new concepts in science in grade four and five classes. Students who participated in direct, explicit instruction of Greek and Latin word parts outperformed students who did not in identifying unfamiliar science concepts that utilized those word parts.

Successful Black students in urban settings are influenced by their home environment, parent-child interactions, and home-to school connections. This is especially true for Black males. When parents are intimately involved in their child's schooling by staying knowledgeable, encouraging and demonstrating the importance of reading, a child's success in school is inevitable (Edwards, 2004). This study focuses on the significance of home literacy attitudes, behaviors, and practices that impact the reading scores of Black boys in third, fourth and fifth grades at three elementary schools in the St. Louis Public School District. The research design is an Explanatory Sequential Quasi-Mixed Methods- Multi-Strand (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006) which is used to explore the relationship between family home literacy behaviors, practices and attitudes and the reading achievement of 3rd, 4th and 5th grade Black boys. Their reading scores from the Missouri Assessment Program (M.A.P.) and Standardized Test for the Assessment of Reading (S.T.A.R.) were analyzed and correlated to responses given by their parents on a parent questionnaire. M.A.P. and S.T.A.R. reading assessment results reveal that few boys included in the current study read at proficient levels; the majority of these boys read at the basic or below basic levels. The findings from this research indicate there is a relationship between parents who create a home literacy environment and the reading scores for third, fourth and fifth grade Black boys. The reading scores analyzed in this study indicate few significant correlations to the home literacy environment; however, the majority of the Black boys' reading scores are below proficient levels.

This study examines the effectiveness of the Orton-Gillingham (OG) Method, a multisensory reading program where instruction utilizes two or more senses simultaneously. Originally developed in the 1930s as a program for dyslexic students, OG has seen continual use since its creation and is endorsed by the American Dyslexic Foundation and the International Dyslexic Foundation. Over the past two decades OG has increasingly been incorporated into general education settings in the primary grades as a reading intervention for struggling readers regardless of whether they have dyslexia. However, there is a dearth of research demonstrating its causal effect as a reading intervention for children with dyslexia or who are experiencing reading delays for other reasons. Two quasi-experimental methods, Regression Discontinuity Design and Nonequivalent Comparison Group Design with propensity scores, are used to test the efficacy of an OG-based, general education reading intervention on a sample of over 700 kindergarten and first grade students who are experiencing reading delays from a large district in California. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessments were used to assign students to the intervention and measure their end-of-year reading outcomes. The results of both analyses revealed no effect for students enrolled in the intervention in either kindergarten or first grade. Within the year that students received the intervention, a small but non-significant gain on end-of-year DIBELS composite scores was found. Long-term outcomes showed that over half of the students in the intervention were still not meeting reading targets by the end of second grade. Moreover, while the treatment effect was found to vary significantly across classrooms and across schools, no available measures classroom or school characteristics where associated with that variation. These findings suggest that certain applications of the OG methodologies may not be effective in general education settings.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Document : Thesis/dissertation : eBook ", "summary": "\r\n   Delays in the development of early literacy skills are associated with a wrath of negative educational outcomes and so addressing such delays is one of the most pressing challenges in education.

Unfortunately, schools continue to operate under assumptions that what works for white students will work for students of color. Solutions and public policies continue to be color-blind and are not culturally responsive. Historically, differences in academic reading outcomes and graduation rates for minority students compared to white students continue to demonstrate vast discrepancies. How much a person can achieve in his or her personal and professional life is significantly related to how proficiently that person can read. Reading is key to success in society and important for social and economic advancement. English language learners who have limited reading skills will continue to be excluded and marginalized even more due to their limited literacy skills. Educational leaders must be willing to renovate and replace current practices through social, cultural and linguistic agendas. In addition, they must be mindful that dyslexia is the most common type of reading difficulty affecting 10% to 17% of the population. In order to continue the political discourse that campaigns for equality in education for English Language Learners with dyslexia, this research focused on the current pedagogical practices existing in elementary schools to support how educational leaders can foster a culturally responsive learning environment. Through the context of Cultural Race Theory and Dyslexia Framework, the use of in-depth interviews, observations and artifacts, highlighted the experiences of ten participants from Blue and Golden Elementary Schools who have an inter-connection with an English Language Learner with dyslexia. The results of this study identify factors that impede and promote the educational learning outcomes of English Language Learners with dyslexia. Recommendations for practice, policy, and future research that encourage equitable practices that support all learners are shared.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   The face of U.S. schools is rapidly changing and Hispanics are the largest minority group in the public schools.

Students who can read actively and reflectively will be able to work successfully with the range of complex texts they will encounter throughout their post-secondary academic careers and beyond. Considering the role of reading within composition from both historical and contemporary perspectives, Carillo makes recommendations for the productive integration of reading instruction into first-year writing courses. She details a \"mindful reading\" framework wherein instructors help students cultivate a repertoire of approaches upon which they consistently reflect as they apply them to various texts. This metacognitive frame allows students to become knowledgeable and deliberate about how they read and gives them the opportunity to develop the skills useful for moving among reading approaches in mindful ways, thus preparing them to actively and productively read in courses and contexts outside first-year composition. Securing a Place for Reading in Composition also explores how the field of composition might begin to effectively address reading, including conducting research on reading, revising outcome statements, and revisiting the core courses in graduate programs. It will be of great interest to writing program administrators and other compositionists and their graduate students.\"--", "sellerPrice": "$24.95", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"Securing a Place for Reading in Composition addresses the dissonance between the need to prepare students to read, not just write, complex texts and the lack of recent scholarship on reading-writing connections.

In The Sense of Style, the bestselling linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker answers these questions and more. Rethinking the usage guide for the 21st century, Pinker doesn't carp about the decline of language or recycle pet peeves from the rulebooks of a century ago. Instead, he applies insights from the sciences of language and mind to the challenge of crafting clear, coherent, and stylish prose. In this short, cheerful, and eminently practical book, Pinker shows how writing depends on imagination, empathy, coherence, grammatical knowhow, and an ability to savor and reverse-engineer the good prose of others. He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish.

They consider different cat personalities, family situations, and personal preferences.Mellie writes an opinion essay for her teacher, Mr. Eagle.

In the end, it's the cousins and the cats that keep a reader turning the page. What kind of cat will Mellie choose? Will Dennis want the same kind of cat?PRAISE FROM CAT EXPERTS\"This is an absolutely delightful book intended for children, but actually one that is informative for adults as well, it reinforces the importance of considering various factors when selecting a cat as a pet. The two cousins are exchanging thoughts about their lifestyles and priorities. They each have a vision of their 'ideal cat.' Though every cat is an individual, the book expresses the value of predictable personality traits and other characteristics of various pedigreed cat breeds. It is a charming story of the two children each going through the process of finding a cat who best fits their own preferences. The playful illustrations compliment the humorous and educational quality of the book.\"--Joan Miller, Cahir, CFA Outreach and Education, Cat Fancier's AssociationThis is quite simply as informative a cat book as any text out there. Each selected breed pinpoints the single most important trait to know about it before choosing a cat 'purrfect' for you. Although written from a child's perspective, it makes clear sense to readers of all ages.

We contemplated on the methodological aspects of teaching English in the Bukovynian schools for girls and the techniques applied for the development of English pronunciation, reading, speaking, writing and translation skills.

To describe readers' approaches to text cohesion and also recognize readers' perceptions of their own process, the study used a close observation of reading processes of nine highly proficient graduate students at a U.S. university with the use of qualitative research methods.

Reports on ways to accommodate these dual language learners (DLLs) cite many case studies, highlighting strategies that prove successful. In this study, the phenomenon of the whole group lesson and ways to support language learners within this context are examined. Curricular shifts and practices that make large group time more meaningful and interactive are important to accommodate both language learners and all of the learners in the group (Sancho Passe, 2013, p. 7). Over the course of the academic year, a case study of three native Russian speaking students enrolled in an English-based Montessori preschool was conducted. Observations were made of these DLL's response to and/or participation in whole group gathering, over time and given specific interventions. What we witnessed caused us to conclude that, overall, group lessons are supportive and certain strategies are more engaging than others. Not surprisingly, during periods of pure conversation the language learners all showed signs of inattentiveness.

This study begins with a general discussion of the artistic demands of the modern short story, and then proceeds to a close study of all Gordimer's published short stories, concentrating on the developments that occur in the characteristic structures and themes of her stories. Each of her collections is dealt with, chronologically, in a separate chapter. In the course of the study, it became clear that two critical approaches were needed in order to explain satisfactorily developments of structure on the one hand, and theme on the other. The basic approach has been close textual reading, which has been enhanced especially after her fifth collection by consideration of the stories' socio-historical dimensions as well. Gordimer's early stories deal with what are later seen to be characteristic themes, race and racial differences, self-deception, illusion, or the stripping away of illusions, turning points in childhood and marriage. Later stories show the developments in these thematic areas, most notably in the field of race. Other stories reveal a growing interest in the role and position of women, and also a preoccupation with betrayal. Gordimer's stories are seen as occupying a position firmly within the tradition of the modern short story. Her characteristic treatment of her material results in what this study sees as a typical Gordimer short story structure.

Data were obtained through one-on-one interviews yielding 12 categories of descriptions that were reduced into four major themes. The essence of participants' lived experience was distilled from these major themes, and the textural and structural descriptions of the phenomenon were formulated. Findings of the study indicated that the ELL college participants liked to implement the 2PM2S GO reading strategy in their reading of expository texts. They reported that the strategy helped them comprehend expository texts, enabled them to retain the information from the text for a long period of time, improved their basic English learning skills, and facilitated their understanding of the main elements of the strategy, which were prior knowledge, prediction, main idea, supporting details, and summarization.

According to Grabe and Stoller (2002, p. 76), a reader must know 95% of the words he or she encounters to read comfortably and fluently. However, many second language learners are unable to reach this threshold when reading university-level native texts. Traditional approaches to teaching reading to language learners such as those outlined in Brown (1994, p. 309) encourage the use of \"compensation strategies\" to make up for this deficit. In this paper, I will outline a theory of reading that explains reading as a hierarchy of efficient and inefficient processes. Efficient processes include automatic word recognition and automatic phrase recognition while \"compensation strategies\" fall under inefficient processes and can therefore overwhelm working memory and cause the reader to lose sense of the text as a whole. Based on this theory of reading, instead of encouraging compensation strategies, as suggested by Brown (1994), reading instruction should attempt to intervene in order to make these strategies unnecessary and allow the reader to continue to use his or her efficient processes. After outlining my theory, I explore techniques that intervene at various stages to keep the L2 reader reading comfortably. I look at pre-reading techniques such as schemata building activities that provide a structure of words, images and ideas on which the reader can build comprehension. I also explore techniques for adapting native texts such as simplification, elaboration and glossing as a means of intervening during reading to prevent the reader from resorting to inefficient processes. I conclude with a lesson plan that incorporates these techniques, provides a blueprint for teaching native texts to non-native learners, and makes reading enjoyable for language learners as an example of how to implement this theory into classroom practice.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   Reading can be frustrating and alienating for second language (L2) learners, but it is crucial to surviving in an L2 environment -- especially an academic environment.
