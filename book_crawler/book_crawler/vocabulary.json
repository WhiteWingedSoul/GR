The L1 translation group received a list of English words translated into Arabic whereas the L2 definition group were given the same list of English words but with English definitions. Participants in both groups were asked to study and memorize the target words along with the meaning of each word. Afterwards, an immediate fill-in-the-blank post-test was given to examine whether L1 translation helps participants recall the given L2 vocabulary. Prior to the post-test, participants were given a questionnaire to indicate the most frequently used strategy when learning L2 vocabulary. After the data were analyzed quantitatively employing an independent t-test, the resultant findings showed that L1 translation indeed promotes the immediate recall of L2 vocabulary among Saudi ESL learners.

Avtorja Aarons in Gittens (1992) pravita, da c\u030ce se otrokovo odklonsko obnas\u030canje ujema z osmimi od devetih alinej za doloc\u030canje avtistic\u030cne motnje, s\u030ce ne pomeni, da je otrok avtistic\u030cen (Aarons in Gittens, 1992). V letih raziskovanj so mnogi pris\u030cli do podobnih ugotovitev. Pri ugotavljanju avtistic\u030cne motnje smo se v nas\u030ci raziskovalni nalogi ravnali po kriterijih Kannerja, ki ga je v svoji knjigi povzela avtorica dr. Ivona Milac\u030cic\u0301. Avtorica v svoji knjigi \"Aspergerjev sindrom ali visoko funkcionalen avtizem\" trdi, da je Kannerjeva raziskava temeljila na opazovanju enajstih otrok in njegova opaz\u030canja so kljuc\u030cna pri danas\u030cnjem odkrivanju avtizma. Kannerjeva opaz\u030canja zajemajo devet stopenj in opisov. 1. Osamljenost - opaz\u030camo, da otrok uz\u030civa v osamljenosti in se nahaja v svojem svetu. Kanner pravi, da je osamljenost razvidna z\u030ce v zgodnjih obdobjih razvoja. 2. Rutine - postanejo sestavni del otrokovega z\u030civljenja na dnevni ravni. Z\u030ce ena sama izkljuc\u030cenost ene dnevne rutine lahko vodi v izbruh agresije. 3. Odlic\u030cen mehanski spomin - na podlagi Kannerjevih zapisov dr. Milac\u030cic\u0301 navaja, da so si otroci brez pomenske informacije zapomnili npr. pesmice v tujih jezikih, abecedo od konca do zac\u030cetka. Pomnjenje taks\u030cnih nenavadnih informacij bi pri normalno razvijajoc\u030cemu se otroku pomenili oviro. 4. Eholalia - nenehno ponavljanje doloc\u030cenih besed. Tukaj dr. Milac\u030cic\u0301 navaja primere, kjer otroci pri komunikaciji navajajo besede, ki so neobic\u030cajne pri vsakdanji komunikaciji. 5. Obc\u030cutljivost na draz\u030cljaje - v primerjavi z ostalimi otroci, so otroci s avtizmom obc\u030cutljivi na razlic\u030cne draz\u030cljaje kot so zvok, hrana, barve, ipd. 6. Stereotipno gibanje bodisi doloc\u030cenih delov telesa npr. glave, prstov ali besedna rutina. 7. Odlic\u030cni kognitivni potenciali - glede na Kannerjeve ugotovitve, v to kategorijo uvrs\u030cc\u030camo otroke z odlic\u030cnim spominom za dogodke, npr. tiste otroke, ki si zapomnijo ali sestavijo kompleksno pesmico, uporabljajo slovnico vis\u030cje ravni, kjer se vidi njihov primer izjemne inteligence 8. Odlic\u030cno pomnjenje informacij na podlagi ponavljanja - veliko otrok z avtizmom kaz\u030ce izjemno moc\u030c spomina 9. Normalen fizic\u030cen zunanji izgled (Aarons in Gittens, 1992). Dr. Lorna Wing in dr. Judith Gould (Wing in Gould, 1979) sta leta 1979 opravili raziskavo na podroc\u030cju epidemiolos\u030cke raziskave otrok prebivalcev toc\u030cno doloc\u030cenega kraja v Londonu. Njuna raziskava je zajemala tudi otroke z avtistic\u030cnimi motnjami in gibalno ovirane otroke. Njun rezultat se je kazal v tem, da imajo otroci z avtistic\u030cno motnjo okvaro socialne narave. Aarons in Gittens navajata, da sta znanstvenici ugotovili, da kljuc\u030cni problem lez\u030ci v okvari druz\u030cbene zveze, socialne komunikacije in druz\u030cbenega razumevanja in domis\u030cljije. - Okvara druz\u030cbene zveze se kaz\u030ce v tem, da bo posameznik navezal druz\u030caben kontakt, vendar bo tez\u030cje razumel pravila druz\u030cbenega vedenja. - Otrok z avtistic\u030cno motnjo se bo v druz\u030cbeno komunikacijo vkljuc\u030cil, ko bo sam z\u030celel, ampak v pogovoru mogoc\u030ce ne bo sodeloval. - Okvare druz\u030cbenega razumevanja in domis\u030cljije se kaz\u030cejo v tem, da se otrok zaveda, da se nekaj dogaja v glavah drugi ljudi, vendar nikakor ne more razvozlati kaj toc\u030cno nekdo predvideva (Wing in Gould, 1993). Dr. Alenka Vojska Kus\u030car (Patterson, 2009) navaja, da lahko znotraj s\u030ctudije stotih primerov otrok z avtizmom, eden od njih kaz\u030ce znac\u030cilnosti avtistic\u030cne motnje bolj ali manj izrazito. Avtizem po mnenju dr. Vojske Kus\u030car predstavlja globalen druz\u030cbeni problem. Nekoc\u030c, pred dvajsetimi leti, naj bi bilo razmerje otrok z avtizmom 1:1000. Po mnenju avtorice se je avtizem razs\u030ciril za desetkrat.

We investigated the instructional strategies this teacher used to support her ELLs in the practices of argumentation and communication, and the ways ELLs constructed and communicated claims, evidence, and reasons in whole class and small group settings as a result. From qualitative analyses of teacher interviews, classroom interactions, and student products, we found that the teacher routinely implemented three types of instructional supports to help ELL students argue from evidence and communicate information: primary language support (although she herself was not fluent in Spanish), deliberate scaffolds, and small group instruction. Further, given these multiple opportunities for engagement, we found that ELLs experienced both successes and challenges participating in class, crafting arguments from evidence, and reading and producing written texts: While ELL students constructed aspects of arguments in small groups, the substance of their discussions was not necessarily reflected in their whole class participation or written products.

Children who do not read well are more likely to be retained a grade in school, drop out of high school, become a teen parent, or enter the juvenile justice system. Building on the extant research and seminal studies, including the National Reading Panel and the National Early Literacy Panel reports, research supported by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) has expanded understanding of ways to identify and help children who are at risk for reading disabilities. This body of work has also contributed to the identification of critical component skills that support proficient reading (e.g., phonological awareness, word knowledge, working memory), better ways to assess these skills, and more effective interventions for children at risk of developing reading difficulties, including children who are deaf or have intellectual disabilities. Research funded by IES has investigated ways to bring these efficacious interventions into our nation's classrooms by developing and evaluating professional development training that increases teachers' knowledge about literacy and how to teach reading effectively to all students, including students who are struggling to learn how to read. This is important because the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress reports that by fourth grade, one-third of our students are failing to attain basic reading skills. In this synthesis, the panel convened by IES, connects the building blocks of assessment, cognitive and linguistic components of reading, effective interventions, and teacher professional development to show how IES-funded research is contributing to solutions for improving reading and preventing reading difficulties. Based on the initial reading of the papers, and following an initial in-person meeting to discuss the articles that were read, the panel organized the contributions into four broad categories with component research questions. They are: (1) Assessment: What has been learned about effective identification and assessment of students who have or are at risk for reading difficulties or disabilities? (2) Basic Cognitive and Linguistic Processes: What are the basic cognitive and linguistic processes that support successful reading and how can these skills be improved for students who have or who are at risk for reading disabilities? (3) Intervention: How can reading instruction be more effective for students who have or are at risk for developing reading disabilities? How can reading be taught to students with low incidence disabilities? (4) Professional Development: How can research-based instructional practices be implemented in the classroom? These categories emerged directly from the articles that the panel members read and they reflect the areas the panel believes that IES-supported research has made contributions to in advancing the understanding of how to improve reading outcomes for students with or at risk for reading disabilities. For each  question, the panel synthesized the available research findings and highlighted key contributions. The panel was given the task of looking across the range of projects that IES has funded in this area to determine what has been learned, where progress has been made as a result of IES funding, and to provide suggestions for further research in improving reading skills of children with or at risk for reading disabilities. In reading this synthesis, readers should remember that it is not intended to be an overview of the existing research on improving reading for children with or at risk for reading disabilities. Panel members were only asked to review those published articles or book chapters that had emerged from IES-funded projects. Specifically, the panel was asked to review articles from peer-reviewed journals and book chapters from funded projects that were published or in press as of December 2011 (thus some articles that were in press in 2011 will have published dates in 2012 or 2013). Thus, there is a great deal of ongoing research that is not represented in this synthesis because some grants are not yet at the stage in the research process where findings are in and summarized for publication.

As has been widely reported, the first randomized trial of Head Start in the program's history found some evidence that it is achieving this goal. Receiving one year of Head Start had small impacts on children's cognitive outcomes, with impacts on cognitive impacts concentrated in the language and literacy domain. However, effects largely faded out by the end of first grade (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). In explaining these results, some have pointed to the variation in quality across Head Start centers. This study uses data for the first follow-up year of the Head Start Impact Study to examine variation in Head Start's impacts on children. Researchers examine whether there is statistically significant variation in Head Start's impacts on children's cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes across individual children, subgroups of children, and Head Start centers. To do so, researchers use a new and innovative methodology for estimating sources of variation in program impacts. In total, 4,440 children in 202 center groups were randomized to treatment or control in the original Head Start Impact Study. The sample is comprised of the subset of children within these 202 center groups for whom there was outcome data available during the study's first follow-up year (N=3,785 children, or 85% of the children originally randomized). Children randomized to treatment were offered a seat in a classroom in a Head Start program in fall 2002 for the 2002-2003 school year. Children randomized to control conditions were free to take up any available early childhood program except for the program provided by the Head Start to which they had applied and had not won a seat. In fall 2002 and in spring 2003, study children were tested by a trained child assessor on an extensive battery of cognitive and socio-emotional assessments. Parents were also surveyed in fall 2002 and spring 2003 on basic demographic information and on dimensions of their children's behavior. Children were followed through third grade, and other data were gathered from various sources (e.g. additional child testing, teacher and center director interviews, direct observations of classroom quality). The analysis is based on data from the fall 2002 and spring 2003 child testing and parent survey only. One important feature of the analysis was comparison of residual outcome variances for treatment and control group members. The analysis of the statistical significance of across-center variance in impacts on children distinguishes between: (1) variation in program effect \"estimates\"; and (2) variation in program \"effects.\" Findings suggest that Head Start had impacts on individual residual variance that have not yet been recognized in analyses of these data. Specifically, Head Start reduced the individual residual variance for treatment group members versus control group members on two important early skills--receptive vocabulary and early math. These findings suggest that Head Start was successful in improving the vocabulary and early numeracy skills of children with lower levels of such skills at entry, with such effects concentrated among dual-language learners and Hispanic children.

With the emphasis placed on connections, mathematics integration, and communication by the New Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (Achieve in Next generation science standards, 2012), more research is needed on how teachers can accomplish this integration (Bunch in Rev Res Educ 37:298-341, 2013; Lee et al. in Educ Res 42(4):223-233, 2013). Science teacher educators, in response to the NGSS, recognize that it is necessary for pre-service and in-service teachers to know more about how instructional strategies in language and science can complement one another. Our purpose in this study was to explore a model of integration that can be used in classrooms. To do this, we examined the change in science content knowledge and academic vocabulary for English language learners (ELLs) as they engaged in inquiry-based science experience utilizing the 5R Instructional Model. Two units, erosion and wind turbines, were developed using the 5R Instructional Model and taught during two different years in a summer school program for ELLs. We analyzed data from interviews to assess change in conceptual understanding and science academic vocabulary over the 60\u00a0h of instruction. The statistics show a clear trend of growth supporting our claim that ELLs did construct more sophisticated understanding of the topics and use more language to communicate their knowledge. As science teacher educators seek ways to prepare elementary teachers to help preK-12 students to learn science and develop the language of science, the 5R Instructional Model is one pathway.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   As teacher educators, we are tasked with preparing prospective teachers to enter a field that has undergone significant changes in student population and policy since we were K-12 teachers.

The Young Scholars model is embedded in a continuum of gifted services offered to a broad range of learners, and it has the capacity to be an important vehicle for change. Young Scholars are students who historically have been underrepresented in gifted programs. This includes students from poverty, students whose primary language is not English, and twice exceptional learners. Staff at Young Scholars schools work together to find and nurture gifted potential as early as kindergarten to ensure that no student is overlooked. The model has two goals: (a) to identify students who may not be considered for gifted programs using traditional methods of identification, and who, without that opportunity, are less likely to pursue advanced levels of learning on their own; and (b) to nurture gifted potential at an early age so that Young Scholars will be prepared to engage in challenging subject matter and rigorous courses in elementary school, middle school, high school, and beyond.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Article : English", "summary": "\r\n   The Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) Young Scholars model offers new language and ideas for thinking about giftedness that embrace expanded beliefs about the nature of intelligence and highlight the importance of nurturing intelligent behavior in children from diverse cultural, ethnic, and linguistic backgrounds as early as possible.

In this fresh, straightforward introduction to teaching English to speakers of other languages he presents teaching techniques and procedures along with the underlying theory and principles. Complex theories and research studies are explained in a clear and comprehensible, yet non-trivial, manner without trivializing them. Practical examples of how to develop teaching materials and tasks from sound principles provide rich illustrations of theoretical constructs. The content is presented through a lively variety of different textual genres including classroom vignettes showing language teaching in action, question and answer sessions, and opportunities to 'eavesdrop' on small group discussions among teachers and teachers in preparation.

Spoken language complexity was measured according to the number and percentage of dependent clauses and instances of non-core words used by students during interviews. When Pearson Correlation statistics were conducted, significant correlations showed there was a relationship between the students' reading comprehension scores and complexity in both their spoken words and sentence structure. These findings support the work of Munro (2011) who found that many students with low reading comprehension benefited from a focus on both grammar and vocabulary while developing the students' expression and reception of oral language.

Eleven NKDs were interviewed about their English learning experiences prior to South Korean university education including English learning in North Korea; their preparation for South Korean university education; and their university English courses with a focus on learning contents, instructors, problems, and supports needed. The results reveal the NKDs\u2019 lack of systematic English education prior to arriving in South Korea as well as their insufficient systematic preparation for university education. Additionally, the lack of basic English knowledge prior to university education produces an English divide between the NKDs and their South Korean peers. They needed much more time to read their English textbooks due to their lack of abilities in grammar, vocabulary, and reading; the American English accents of their native English instructors also caused listening problems. Nonetheless, the universities and government agencies have neglected this issue and do not seem to have a systematic administration or supportive system for the NKDs\u2019 English education. The study suggests a holisticapproach to establish interagency policies to resolve such problems.|\ud0c8\ubd81 \ub300\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc740 \ub0a8\ud55c \ub300\ud559 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c

This study conducted a semi-structured interview of North Korean Defectors (NKDs) attending South Korean universities to explore their pre-university and university English education including English-mediated or university English courses. Eleven NKDs were interviewed about their English learning experiences prior to South Korean university education including English learning in North Korea; their preparation for South Korean university education; and their university English courses with a focus on learning contents, instructors, problems, and supports needed. The results reveal the NKDs\u2019 lack of systematic English education prior to arriving in South Korea as well as their insufficient systematic preparation for university education. Additionally, the lack of basic English knowledge prior to university education produces an English divide between the NKDs and their South Korean peers. They needed much more time to read their English textbooks due to their lack of abilities in grammar, vocabulary, and reading; the American English accents of their native English instructors also caused listening problems. Nonetheless, the universities and government agencies have neglected this issue and do not seem to have a systematic administration or supportive system for the NKDs\u2019 English education. The study suggests a holisticapproach to establish interagency policies to resolve such problems.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Article", "edition_format": "Downloadable article : English", "summary": "\r\n   This study conducted a semi-structured interview of North Korean Defectors (NKDs) attending South Korean universities to explore their pre-university and university English education including English-mediated or university English courses.

The book investigates ways in which learners successfully develop their language skills through extramural English and provides tools for teachers to make use of free time activities in primary and secondary education. The authors demonstrate that learning from involvement in extramural English activities tends to be incidental and is currently underutilized in classroom work. A distinctive strength is that this volume is grounded in theory, builds on results from empirical studies, and manages to link theory and research with practice in a reader-friendly way. Teacher-educators, teachers and researchers of English as a foreign language and teachers of English as a second language across the globe will find this book useful in developing their use of extramural English activities as tools for language learning.

Of major interest to historians, philologists, linguists, and the general reader, the Thesaurus is an unrivalled resource for the historical study of the language. It is based on a comprehensive analysis of English as found in the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and A Thesaurus of Old English (for words restricted to the Old English period of c.700-1150 AD). All these words and their dates of recorded use are displayed within a detailed semantic framework, offering a fascinating picture of the development of the vocabulary of English from its origins in Anglo-Saxon times to the present. Such an arrangement casts new light on the relationship between the things and ideas people talk about and the words they use and have used in the past, as well as on the words themselves. By browsing through the Thesaurus, or examining one of its categories in detail, the reader will encounter a huge variety of intriguing words from many different sources, ranging from the rare or obsolete to those which have been in daily use for hundreds of years or introduced recently. This online version enables users to pinpoint the range of meanings of a word throughout its history, their synonyms, and their relationship to words of more general or more specific meaning.

Model-based predictors of RD were analyzed using logistic regression; isolated measure/criteria combinations for predicting RD were analyzed using classification analysis. Models yielded superior classification rates compared to single measure approaches and did not systematically misclassify English learners. However, particular first and second grade measure/criteria combinations also showed promise as isolated predictors of RD in word reading/text fluency. Model-based approaches were required for acceptable classification of students with RD in comprehension. Although the former finding is promising for early identification of students in need of more intensive instruction in lexical or fluency-based skills, the latter finding reaffirms literature attesting to the complexity of RD in comprehension and difficulty of predicting deficits using early measures of reading, which primarily assess word reading skill.

To meet these aims, we observed and recorded reading/language arts instruction in 33 classrooms at three points during an academic year, and we assessed 274 students on vocabulary and comprehension at the beginning and end of the year. Using field notes and student utterances to understand the context, we coded teacher utterances (e.g., questions, comments, prompts) as vocabulary instruction, comprehension instruction, other instruction, or noninstruction. We then identified five types of vocabulary-related instruction and five types of comprehension-related instruction. Using latent difference modeling, we investigated how the frequency of different types of instruction was associated with change in students' vocabulary and comprehension across the school year. Teachers' instruction related to definitions, word relations, and morphosyntax was positively associated with change in vocabulary; teachers' instruction related to application across contexts and literal comprehension was negatively associated with change in vocabulary; and teachers' instruction related to inferential comprehension was positively associated with change in comprehension.

It contains 16 chapters which address important elements of grammar, with some including mini bilingual dictionaries, with words organised not alphabetically but thematically, with the singular aim of facilitating learning and easy acquisition of the language. Durorp is an interesting and linguistically distinct semi-Bantu or Bantoid language spoken by a minority group of people known as Bororp or people of the Kororp ethnic group. A part of this ethnic group inhabits the Southwestern part of Cameroon while the other occupies the Southeastern tip of Nigeria.

Sections F and G present and practice idioms and phrases from the chapter. Section H includes reading comprehension exercises on salient details of the chapter.

It asks students to write about, reflect on, and discuss the ideas, opinions, and questions that may arise from the reading.

This allows students to focus and learn contextualized vocabulary, and not to become overwhelmed; In exercises A & D throughout the workbook, the correct vocabulary item fits grammatically into exactly what is underlined; Vocabulary builds consecutively in the workbook. A word defined in an earlier chapter may be used later in a definition. Students are thereby given more opportunities to learn and recognize the new vocabulary; In the Word Builder section, sometimes grammar is introduced that is more advanced than the level.

This study examines the epistemic beliefs of English language learners, a population of learners that is relatively understudied on the topic of personal epistemology. More specifically, this qualitative study explores ELLs' dimensional and developmental epistemic beliefs about vocabulary knowledge in English. First-year international undergraduate students enrolled in remedial ESL writing courses were given a series of speaking and writing placement tests in an Intensive ESL program at a Mid-western university. Responses to writing prompts and interviews were analyzed for this study from an epistemological lens to determine the espoused epistemic beliefs of English language learners. Results suggested that many ELLs espoused advanced epistemic beliefs (i.e., evaluativism) about vocabulary knowledge most of the time. There was a general disparity found, however, with ELLs' epistemic beliefs about the source and justification of English vocabulary knowledge. That is, there was a tendency for ELLs to espouse less sophisticated epistemic beliefs (i.e., absolutism) about source and justification of vocabulary knowledge. This implies that participants' beliefs about these dimensions of knowledge and knowing might be hindering the emergence of more sophisticated epistemic beliefs in the domain of English language learning. Additional implications suggest that ESL curriculum needs to focus on developing ELLs' use of the appropriate cognitive strategies (i.e., critical thinking) to determine the most accurate sources of vocabulary knowledge in specified communicative contexts.", "sellerPrice": null, "docType": "Book, Archival Material, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Thesis/dissertation : Thesis/dissertation : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   There is a growing body of work that examines the epistemic beliefs of learners and the role those beliefs play in the development of their critical thinking and other cognitive processes (Hofer, 2001).

Contributors address the development, transformation, and interconnections among thirty-six of the most critical terms that make up writing studies. Looking beyond basic definitions or explanations, they explore the multiple layers of meaning within the terms that writing scholars currently use, exchange, and question. Each term featured is a part of the general disciplinary parlance, and each is a highly contested focal point of significant debates about matters of power, identity, and values. Each essay begins with the assumption that its central term is important precisely because its meaning is open and multiplex. Keywords in Writing Studies reveals how the key concepts in the field are used and even challenged, rather than advocating particular usages and the particular vision of the field that they imply.

For writing, students are required to engage the reader and produce a response, which relates to the purpose and audience. This book teaches students how to write using different purposes - to inform, explain, argue, advise, describe, persuade, review and how to make the tone and register of their writing suitable for the audience. It emphasises the P.E.E or P.E.T.E.R technique, so students have a blue print (format) to work from; make POINT, give EVIDENCE, comment on TECHNIQUE, EFFECT and RESPONSE. This helps students to develop analytical skills for non-fiction tasks and responses in English literature papers. The students are also taught to use rhetorical techniques - groups of three, speaking directly to the reader, rhetorical questions, inclusive pronouns as well as stylistic devices like similes, metaphors and high level vocabulary.

The book has been divided into four convenient units of Grammar, Pronunciation, Conversation and Vocabulary. Each chapter covers one main area of learning English - explained thoroughly with examples and special attention being given to the basic skills. Carefully selected and balanced practical exercises have also been designed and included with each topic or chapter to give the readers or learners, particularly the students, ample practice and a complete understanding of the subject.

The Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) has been shown to include important vocabulary in written academic texts, and has become a standard part of English for Academic Purposes curricula and pedagogical materials. Although explicit vocabulary instruction is important, research has shown that large amounts of vocabulary may be acquired incidentally by attending to meaning. Classroom instruction provides a great deal of input, and could potentially offer a chance for students to encounter and begin to learn academic vocabulary through incidental acquisition.

In the sciences, there are at least three characteristics that create the necessity to approach vocabulary differently; the novelty of the concepts the vocabulary represents to students, the inordinate amount of new words encountered in the sciences, and the lack of explicit vocabulary acquisition instruction provided by science teachers. If students were able to leverage their understanding of words and word meanings and improve their automaticity of understanding the morphology of words, they may be able to improve their overall comprehension of text as well as concepts. The Matthew Effect and the Reciprocal Model both underscore the causal nature of the vocabulary-reading comprehension relationship. They also support the sense of immediacy necessary to keep children from falling further and further behind their peers. It is possible, even at the intermediate level, to enhance a student's reading comprehension skills and content area conceptual understandings through direct vocabulary study. This study documents the benefits of using Greek and Latin word parts in ELA to acquire vocabulary and understand new concepts in science in grade four and five classes. Students who participated in direct, explicit instruction of Greek and Latin word parts outperformed students who did not in identifying unfamiliar science concepts that utilized those word parts.

{"genre_form": null, "publisher": "[Long Beach, California] : California State University, Long Beach, 2015.", "onlineName": "search.proquest.com", "description": "1 online resource (vii, 129 pages).", "name": "An interventional study : adult ESL beginners and advanced learners on acquiring and producing pragmatic requests", "author": "Monica Elena Leal McGuthrie", "abstract": "\n           Abstract: Second language (L2) learners are usually given a limited amount of exposure to pragmatic instruction even though researchers have advocated the importance of teaching pragmatics in the classroom (Alco\u0301n-Soler, 2008; Bardovi-Harlig, 1990; Cohen, 1996). One area that is discussed among researchers is learners' proficiency and its effect on acquiring pragmatic competence. On one hand, researchers argue that learners need to have a high level of linguistic competence or proficiency in order to produce complex linguistic pragmatic functions. Researchers such as Codina-Espurz (2008) believe that there needs to be \"a certain degree of linguistic competence\" (p. 229) in order to gain pragmatic competence. In other words, lower L2 level learners may not find it beneficial to receive instruction since they lack the vocabulary to produce appropriate pragmatic responses. However, researchers have found that even having a high level of linguistic competence does not mean gaining complete native-like pragmatic competence (Bardovi-Harlig & Hartford, 1990; Hill, 1997). On the other hand, researchers suggest that pedagogical intervention even at the beginning level is beneficial (Tateyama et al., 1997; Wildner-Bassett, 1994). This study involves teaching pragmatic requests to adult English second language (ESL) learners of beginner and advanced intact classes at a non-profit organization called Meet Each Need with Dignity (MEND) in Pacoima, California. The study was of mixed methods, and data were collected using pre and posttests that included a written and oral role-play portion called a Discourse Completion Test (DCT), a Multiple-Choice assessment (MC), and a Background Questionnaire (BQ). Additionally, an interview and a delayed posttest were given three months later to one learner from each level to study the effect instruction had on their request development. Furthermore, this study wanted to find if pragmatic instruction had an effect on acquiring and producing appropriate responses to different request situations.
