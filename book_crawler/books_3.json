Farnsworth\u2019s book is the finest collection of such figurative comparisons ever assembled. It offers an original analysis of patterns in the sources and uses of metaphor. It also explains the different stylistic ways that comparisons can be written, and with what effects. The book starts by dividing the sources of metaphor into families, including nature, architecture, animals, and myth. It then shows how the best writers have put each of those traditions to distinctive use-for the sake of caricature, to make an abstract idea visible, to make a complicated idea simple. The book provides, along the way, an extraordinarily wide-ranging tour of examples from novelists, playwrights, philosophers, and orators. There is interest, instruction, and amusement to be found on every page. Ward Farnsworth-lawyer, dean, teacher, and polymath-has produced another indispensable book for the writer.

Part 2 gives practical suggestions on how to help your students improve their presentation skills. In Part 3 you will learn how to teach academic skills using nonacademic examples. Parts 1-3 are thus useful for anyone involved in teaching academic English, whether they have used the other books in the series or not. Part 4 suggests two syllabuses for teaching writing and presenting skills, based on the two core books: English for Writing Research Papers English for Presentations at International Conferences This book will help you i) understand the world of your students (i.e. academic research), ii) plan courses, and iii) exploit the What's the Buzz? sections in the books on Writing, Presentations, Correspondence and Interacting on Campus.

There is wide variation in impact estimates. To glean what drives this variation, we link these effects to school practices, inputs, and characteristics of fallback schools. In line with the earlier literature, we find that schools that adopt an intensive \"No Excuses\" attitude towards students are correlated with large gains in academic performance, with traditional inputs like class size playing no role in explaining charter school effects. However, we highlight that \"No Excuses\" schools are also located among the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the country. After accounting for performance levels at fallback schools, the relationship between the remaining variation in school performance and the entire \"No Excuses\" package of practices weakens. \"No Excuses\" schools are effective at raising performance in neighborhoods with very poor performing schools, but the available data have less to say on whether the \"No Excuses\" approach could help in nonurban settings or whether other practices would similarly raise achievement in areas with low-performing schools.

Antiquarians and archaeologists early recognised the family resemblance of the different groups of tombs, attributing them to maritime peoples moving along the western seaways. More recent research sees them rather as the product of established early farming communities in their individual regions. Yet the diversity of the tombs, their chronologies and their varied cultural contexts complicates any straightforward understanding of their origins and distribution. Megalithic Architectures provides new insight by focusing on the construction and design of European megalithic tombs--on the tomb as an architectural project. It shows how much is to be learned from detailed attention to the stages and the techniques through which tombs were built, modified and enlarged, and often intentionally dismantled or decommissioned. The large slabs that were employed, often unshaped, may suggest an opportunistic approach by the Neolithic builders, but this was clearly far from the case. Each building project was unique, and detailed study of individual sites exposes the way in which tombs were built as architectural, social and symbolic undertakings. Alongside the manner in which the materials were used, it reveals a store of knowledge that sometimes differed considerably from one structure to another, even between contemporary monuments within a single region. The volume brings together regional specialists from Scandinavia, Germany, Britain, France, Belgium and Iberia to offer a series of uniquely authoritative studies.

In North Carolina, we visit the nation's fastest-growing community-development credit union, serving immigrants and U.S.- born depositors and helping to lower borrowing thresholds and crime rates alike.

The Battle of Culloden in 1746 has gone down in history as the last major battle fought on British soil: a vicious confrontation between the English Royal Army and the Scottish forces supporting the Stuart claim to the throne. But this wasn't just a conflict between the Scots and the English: the battle was also part of a much larger campaign to protect the British Isles from the growing threat of a French invasion. In Trevor Royle's vivid and evocative narrative, we are drawn into the ranks, on both sides, alongside doomed Jacobites fighting fellow Scots dressed in the red coats of the Duke of Cumberland's Royal Army. And we meet the Duke himself, a skilled warrior who would gain notoriety because of the reprisals on Highland clans in the battle's aftermath. Royle also takes us beyond the battle as the Royal Army, galvanized by its success at Culloden, expands dramatically and start to fight campaigns overseas in America and India in order to secure British interests. Culloden changed the course of British history--by ending all hope of the Stuarts reclaiming the throne and cementing Hanoverian rule to form the bedrock for the creation of the British Empire. Royle's lively and provocative history looks afresh at the period and unveils its true significance, not only as the end of a struggle for the throne but the beginning of a new global power.\"--Dust jacket.", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English : First Pegasus Books hardcover edition", "summary": "\r\n   \"A vigorous, authoritative history of the last major battle fought between Scottish and English forces, resulting in the formation of the bedrock of the British Empire.

Arguments for diversification tend to be couched in terms of disproportionate representation and students from minority backgrounds needing positive role models, yet research identifies other compelling reasons for diversification, including the fact that teachers of migrant backgrounds often possess outstanding qualifications when multilingualism and internationally obtained education and experience are taken into account, and the fact that all students, including majority-background students, benefit from a diversity of role models in schools. Nevertheless, the process of diversification is fraught with complexity. Depending on the context, systemic discrimination, an oversupply of teachers in the profession generally, and outdated hiring policies and practices can all impede efforts to diversify the teaching force. This volume comprises original research from Canada, the U.S., Germany, Ireland, Scotland, and England that problematizes issues of diversifying the teaching force and identifies promising practices. A foreword written by Charlene Bearhead of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation questions the very purpose of education in and for diverse societies. An introduction written by the editors defines key concepts and establishes a rationale for diversifying the teaching force in migrant-receiving contexts.

He knew everyone of note in England-writers, philosophers, mathematicians, doctors, astrologers, lawyers, statesmen-and wrote about them all, leaving behind a great gift to posterity: a compilation of biographical information titled Brief Lives, which in a strikingly modest and radical way invented the art of biography. Aubrey was born in Wiltshire, England, in 1626. The reign of Queen Elizabeth and, earlier, the dissolution of the monasteries were not too far distant in memory during his boyhood. He lived through England's Civil War, the execution of Charles I, the brief rule of Oliver Cromwell and his son, and the restoration of Charles II. Experiencing these constitutional crises and regime changes, Aubrey was impassioned by the preservation of traces of Ancient Britain, of English monuments, manor houses, monasteries, abbeys, and churches. He was a natural philosopher, an antiquary, a book collector, and a chronicler of the world around him and of the lives of his friends, both men and women. His method of writing was characteristic of his manner: modest, self-deprecating, witty, and concerned above all with the collection of facts that would otherwise be lost to time. John Aubrey, My Own Life is an extraordinary book about the first modern biographer, which reimagines what biography can be. This intimate diary of Aubrey's days is composed of his own words, collected, collated, and enlarged upon by Ruth Scurr in an act of meticulous scholarship and daring imagination. Scurr's biography honors and echoes Aubrey's own innovations in the art of biography. Rather than subject his life to a conventional narrative, Scurr has collected the evidence-the remnants of a life from manuscripts, letters, and books-and arranged it chronologically, modernizing words and spellings, and adding explanations when necessary, with sources provided in the extensive endnotes. Here are Aubrey's intricate drawings of Stonehenge and the ancient Avebury stones; Aubrey on Charles I's execution (\"On this day, the King was executed. It was bitter cold, so he wore two heavy shirts, lest he should shiver and seem afraid\"); and Aubrey on antiquity (\"Matters of antiquity are like the light after sunset-clear at first-but by and by crepusculum-the twilight-comes-then total darkness\").

It addresses the need to investigate how humanities discussions, often exclusively drawn from, and grounded in, western contexts, are today being played out in these three places. The humanities in contemporary Chinese contexts may have different social and pedagogical roles, and a consideration of them will enable people to moderate, and perhaps even refute, claims made in the recent (re)readings of the humanities. As Asian universities rise in the global rankings and as east-west university collaborations and partnerships become more common, it is important that the nature, practice and institutionalization of the humanities in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China are explored and described for English readers. Exploring new perspectives arising from an examination of the humanities in these places, this volume aims neither to establish a position of polarity, which would pit western sites against Chinese ones, nor to argue for universal sameness. Rather, the goal is to find nuanced correspondences and differences between these various backgrounds, so that there is a greater understanding of the specificities of Chinese contexts. This will help shed light not only on the contexts in question, but also potentially on how to rearticulate the importance of the humanities in general, creating an intercultural dialogue focused on the humanities. As the global university strives to move the different traditions of learning closer together through international rankings, rubrics, and shared research agendas, it is important that we explore these locations of potential cultural exchange.", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   This book brings together the perspectives of eminent and emerging scholars on contemporary issues relevant to the practice, pedagogy and institutionalization of the humanities in the three Chinese contexts of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China.

The major strength of this important and lively new book is Ian Brown\u2019s encyclopaedic knowledge of the rich and diverse theatrical culture of Scotland, combined with his understanding of wider European traditions and his experience as a playwright. This combination enables him to trace genealogies, offer comparative commentary and it facilitates a deep understanding of the ideological consequences of themes, myths, language, dramaturgy and theatrical strategies. Focusing on leading Scottish playwrights including David Greig, Liz Lochhead, John McGrath, Robert McLellan and Rona Munro, Brown explores how they have created plays that draw attention to competing versions of history, marginalised histories and the potential to revision history as a way of engaging in debates around such themes as power, independence, gender and the past and future of the Scottish nation.\" - Nadine Holdsworth, Professor of Theatre and Performance, Warwick University, UK \"Ian Brown has written an excellent book about the infinite adaptability of history. He opened my eyes to a world of pre-20th century Scottish drama of which I was only dimly aware. He also writes about more familiar figures, from Barrie and Bridie to Lochhead and Munro with a scholarly brio that demonstrates their ability to find a metaphor for the present in the past. I learned a massive amount from Ian Brown's informed intelligence.\" - Michael Billington, the Guardian theatre critic This revelatory study explores how Scottish history plays, especially since the 1930s, raise issues of ideology, national identity, historiography, mythology, gender and especially Scottish language. Covering topics up to the end of World War Two, the book addresses the work of many key figures from the last century of Scottish theatre, including Robert McLellan and his contemporaries, and also Hector MacMillan, Stewart Conn, John McGrath, Donald Campbell, Bill Bryden, Sue Glover, Liz Lochhead, Jo Clifford, Peter Arnott, David Greig, Rona Munro and others often neglected or misunderstood. Setting these writers\u2019 achievements in the context of their Scottish and European predecessors, Ian Brown offers fresh insights into key aspects of Scottish theatre. As such, this represents the first study to offer an overarching view of historical representation on Scottish stages, exploring the nature of \u2018history\u2019 and \u2018myth\u2019 and relating these afresh to how dramatists use \u2013 and subvert \u2013 them.

Modern science has proven that people behave and learn in distinctive ways. And yet these individual patterns get lost in our institutions of opportunity--from education to the workforce--which remain rooted in the misguided belief that statistical averages are good enough to understand individuals and identify their unique talents. Standardized tests, grading systems, job applicant profiling, performance reviews--they invariably ignore our differences and ultimately fail at measuring our capacity for success. In this first popular book on the science of the individual, Todd Rose, a pioneer in the field draws on the latest research to show how, when we focus on individual findings rather than group findings or averages, we can rethink the world and everyone's potential in it. By understanding the three \"principles of individuality\"--The principle of the jagged profile, the principle of context, and the principle of pathways--we can avoid setting ourselves and those we are tasked with helping succeed (our children, students, employees) up for repeated failure and instead find the right path for success. The End of Average reminds us that we are not anything close to average--because the average is a statistical myth--and presents a new way of understanding and maximizing everyone's potential\"", "docType": "Book, Internet Resource", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   The rising star and face of the new field \"science of the individual\" draws from the latest psychological and sociological research to show that success is found in individual strengths and weaknesses that don't fit along any average curve--a powerful manifesto for change in the ranks of Emotional Intelligence and The Power of Habit.

It is a book that combines permanence and relevance, that addresses a pressing political and civilizational problem in a manner that will endure. Responding to the brutal terror attacks in France in January 2015, Pierre Manent has written a learned, passionate essay that reflects broadly and deeply on the political and religious situation of France and Europe. He freely acknowledges that the West is at war with fanatics who despise liberal and Christian civilization. That war must be conducted with prudent tough-mindedness. At the same time, serious thought must be given to the Islamic question at home and abroad. Concentrating on the French situation, Manent suggests that French Muslims are not entering an 'empty' nation, defined by radical secularism and human rights alone. France has a secular state, as do all the nations of the contemporary West. That is a heritage to be cherished. But the Islamic question will not be 'solved' by transforming Muslims into modern secularists devoid of all religious sensibility.

Shifts in perspective also view language not simply as an instrument for cognition with all learners equipped with this instrument in service of learning, although clearly in the classroom that remains of importance. Rather, it is now also being acknowledged that language use is inherently political, so that the language that gets official recognition in the classroom is invariably the language of the powerful elite, or the dominant societal language, or in the case of post-colonial contexts the language of the colonisers. From this socio-political role of language in learning quite different issues arise for teaching, learning and curriculum for linguistically marginalized learners than that of cognition (e.g. immigrants, second language learners, other). Policies on language in education are being considered and re-considered with specific reference to mathematics teaching and learning. Given the policy environment, globally the proposed publication is timely. This edited collection draws on recent, emerging insights and understandings about the approaches to improving policy and practice in mathematics education and mathematics teacher education in multilingual settings. It presents, and discusses critically, examples of work from a range of contexts and uses these examples to draw out key issues for research in education in language diverse settings including teaching, learning, curriculum and fit these with appropriate policy and equity approaches.

By 1977, he was ready to go into business for himself. The company he founded on a shoe-string, United Cleaning Services, quickly expanded into a multi-million dollar, country-wide enterprise that now employs almost 5,000 people, many of whom are immigrants like himself. Throughout all this, Kroupa has remained a modest, down-to-earth man who doesn't see himself as extraordinary at all.

Lauren Collins discovered this firsthand when, in her early thirties, she moved to London and fell for a Frenchman named Olivier-- a surprising turn of events for someone who didn't have a passport until she was in college. But what does it mean to love someone in a second language? Collins wonders, as her relationship with Olivier continues to grow entirely in English. Are there things she doesn't understand about Olivier, having never spoken to him in his native tongue? Does 'I love you' even mean the same thing as 'je t'aime'? When the couple, newly married, relocates to Francophone Geneva, Collins-- fearful of one day becoming 'a Borat of a mother' who doesn't understand her own kids-- decides to answer her questions for herself by learning French. When in French is a laugh-out-loud funny and surprising memoir about the lengths we go to for love, as well as an exploration across culture and history into how we learn languages-- and what they say about who we are. Collins grapples with the complexities of the French language, enduring excruciating role-playing games with her classmates at a Swiss language school and accidentally telling her mother-in-law that she's given birth to a coffee machine. In learning French, Collins must wrestle with the very nature of French identity and society-- which, it turns out, is a far cry from life back home in North Carolina.

Rebelling against his pressure-cooker of a life, Ken determined to drop out of high school to follow his own path. To obtain his father's approval, he invoked the biography of the famous Indian mathematical prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan, whom his father revered, who had twice flunked out of college because of his single-minded devotion to mathematics. Ono describes his rocky path through college and graduate school, interweaving Ramanujan's story with his own and telling how at key moments, he was inspired by Ramanujan and guided by mentors who encouraged him to pursue his interest in exploring Ramanujan's mathematical legacy. Picking up where others left off, beginning with the great English mathematician G.H. Hardy, who brought Ramanujan to Cambridge in 1914, Ono has devoted his mathematical career to understanding how in his short life, Ramanujan was able to discover so many deep mathematical truths, which Ramanujan believed had been sent to him as visions from a Hindu goddess. And it was Ramanujan who was ultimately the source of reconciliation between Ono and his parents. Ono's search for Ramanujan ranges over three continents and crosses paths with mathematicians whose lives span the globe and the entire twentieth century and beyond.

When Prue's father employs a British pilot, William Harrington, to take aerial photographs of the city, Prue is uncomfortably aware of the attraction that sparks between him and Eleanora, the English wife of a famous Jerusalem photographer. And, after Harrington learns that Eleanora's husband is a nationalist, intent on removing the British, those sparks fan dangerously into a flame. Years later, in 1937, Prue is an artist living a reclusive life by the sea with her young son, when Harrington pays her a surprise visit.

What have we learned from debates about competing poetic eras and traditions? How is our understanding of an older writer reshaped by engaging with later ones?

Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may help explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today. Combining history, psychology, and anthropology, TRIBE explores what we can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony that -- for many veterans as well as civilians -- war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. TRIBE explains why we are stronger when we come together, and how that can be achieved even in today's divided world.", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English : First edition", "summary": "\r\n   Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to the Indians -- but Indians almost never did the same.

Taken from his Czechoslovakian home at age fifteen and transported to the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz with his family, Greenfield came face to face with 'Angel of Death' Dr. Joseph Mengele and was divided forever from his parents, sisters, and baby brother. In haunting, powerful prose, Greenfield remembers his desperation and fear as a teenager alone in the death camp--and how an SS soldier's shirt dramatically altered the course of his life. He learned how to sew; and when he began wearing the shirt under his prisoner uniform, he learned that clothes possess great power and could even help save his life. Measure of a Man is the story of a man who suffered unimaginable horror and emerged with a dream of success. From sweeping floors at a New York clothing factory to founding America's premier custom suit company, Greenfield built a fashion empire. Now 86 years old and working with his sons, Greenfield has dressed the famous and powerful of D.C. and Hollywood, including Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, celebrities Paul Newman, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Jimmy Fallon, and the stars of Martin Scorsese's films.

Unfortunately, this flawed thinking is the foundation upon which many students declare their undergraduate major. With the repayment of college loans as a paramount issue for students and their families, the major is often viewed as the stepping stone for a career that can repay those loans instead of the first step to a meaningful life based on leadership, purpose, and service. Students should declare a major that makes them happy. Doing so substantially increases their chances of pursuing careers paths that ignite their passion, identify with their purpose, and spark a commitment to lifelong learning. All too often, however, students are exposed to the myopic valuable versus useless paradigm of decision-making process when it comes to declaring a major. According to this paradigm, a \"valuable\" major is useful, can teach a specific skill, and provides one with a lifetime of employment and riches. Accounting, marketing, engineering, and computer science are just a few examples. A \"worthless\" major, on the other hand, is more intellectual and therefore has little, or no, practical application for employment purposes. Majors that generally fall into this category include history, English, philosophy, and sociology among others. This dichotomy between the valuable versus useless majors is based on flawed mental models and ingrained assumptions about how the world works that lead to a series of fallacies surrounding the college major. Major in Happiness: Debunking the College Major Fallacies examines a variety of assumptions prevalent in the mental models of undergraduates, parents, educators, higher education leaders, administrators, and policymakers that cause people to fall into a series of mental traps when selecting a major. Divided into three parts, this publication presents a situational analysis on choosing a college major, dissects the mental models and traps people rely on, and offers a variety of assessments that can help increase one's self-awareness prior to declaring a major.", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English : First edition", "summary": "\r\n   The preconceptions and suspicions about how things operate in today's challenging global marketplace often compel people to forge correlations with causations without any substantial evidence.

It was necessary for this dark hour to fall, perhaps the darkest in history, to make us realize that freedom is as vital to our soul as breathing to our body.' As Europe faced its darkest days, Stefan Zweig was a passionate voice for tolerance, peace and a world without borders. In these moving, ardent essays, speeches and articles, composed before and during the Second World War, one of the twentieth century's greatest writers mounts a defence of European unity against terror and brutality. From the dreamlike 'The Sleepless World', written in 1914, through the poignant 'The Vienna of Yesterday', to the impassioned 'In This Dark Hour', one of his final addresses, given in 1941, Zweig envisages a Europe free of nationalism and pledged to pluralism, culture and brotherhood. These haunting lost messages, all appearing in English for the first time and some newly discovered, distil Zweig's courage, belief and richness of learning to give the essence of a writer; a spiritual will and testament to stand alongside his memoir, The World of Yesterday. Brief and yet intense, they are a tragic reminder of a world lost to the 'bloody vortex of history', but also a powerful statement of one man's belief in the creative imagination and the potential of humanity, with a resounding relevance today.

China, Japan and Russia represented at some moments modern threats, but also denoted a range of alternative modernity possibilities, and ultimately provided a model for Korea's pre-colonial and colonial modernity. This book explores the way in which modern Korea perceived its geographic neighbours from the 1890s until 1945. It shows that Korea's modern nationalism was at the same time internationalist in its orientation, as the vision of Korea's ideal place in the world and brighter national future was often linked to the examples (positive and negative), threats (perceived and real) and allies abroad. Exploring the importance of the international knowledge and experience for the formation of the Korean nationalist paradigms, it offers nuance to the existing picture of the international connections and environment of the Korean national movements. It shows that the picture of Japan inside the anti-Japanese independence movement of the colonial period was more complicated than simple hatred of the invaders: modern achievements of Japan were admired even by anti-colonial nationalists as a possible model for Korea. The book also demonstrates the extent to which Chinese and Soviet revolutions influenced the thinking of modern Korean intellectuals across the whole ideological spectrum.

The author has conducted extensive fieldwork in Pakistan and the UK to study migration between the two countries. Individuals' access to the dominant literacies of migration are contrasted with the vernacular practices which migrants take up at home as part of their digital literacies. The study explores the blurring of boundaries between home and school as well as the blurring of boundaries between language varieties. Tracing access to literacy in this way also shines a light on the literacy mediators migrants turn to for help with English language learning and when trying to access the bureaucratic literacies of migration. The study ends by exploring how migrants use all of their language resources, not just English, to fit into their new homes once they have arrived in the UK.

Lawrence is suspected of beating his wife, Bonnie, for cheating on him with an American architect. It appears Bonnie and their daughter, Lucy, have done the sensible thing and fled. But when a corpse turns up, burned beyond recognition, the police decide to comb Wumpett Woods in search of a second body. Soon Lawrence is branded a murderer and arrested. Then Bonnie and Lucy turn up alive, and Lawrence is cleared. But he has lost his family. He takes a five-hundred-passenger cruise on the SS Paulina, where a chanteuse of a certain age-and uncertain gender-captivates him. Lawrence begins a new journey, a spiritual and erotic odyssey that takes him back to the buried secrets of his past and then onward toward the future. From the English provinces to the Caribbean to America-and the giant redwoods of northern California-filled with Shakespearean twists and turns and happy coincidences, Tree Surgery for Beginners is a sprawling, Dickensian carnival of a book.

Alongside their interest in digital media, schooling constitutes a core component of the life of children and adolescents. Youth\u2019s use of digital media creates tensions between traditions and expectations of renewal within the school. The once-sharp divide between school and leisure time is eroding. How will the school as an institution relate to this comprehensive process of change known as the digital revolution? How can the school build a bridge between the world of youth and school material to enable students to learn in a new digital age? This endeavor is named polycontextual bridging in this book. What are the good examples of polycontextual bridging? What novel educational goals can be achieved by net-related activities when incorporated into the school, and how can out-of-school learning be successfully framed by educational purposes? These questions are addressed from different perspectives by several scholars in this book. The chapters in this volume offer the most thorough, up-to-date discussion on the challenges of technology use in school education. In tackling the critical issues created by technology, this book provides an important resource for student teachers, teachers, education scholars and those interested in a critical examination of digital expectations and experiences in school education. This book is motivated by a pressing need to come to grips with the dilemmas caused by an apparent clash of learning cultures in the individual classroom, in the schools, in the education of teachers, and in the institutions of teacher education. The book is also a tribute to Gavriel Salomon and his research on the cognitive effects of media's symbol systems, media and learning, and the design of cognitive tools and technology-afforded learning environments. The book also contains his masterpiece \u201cIt\u2019s not just the tool, but the educational rationale that counts\u201d. Further, three internationally recognized experts \u2013 Howard Gardner, David Perkins, and Daniel Bar-Tal \u2013 describe Salomon\u2019s remarkable academic contributions. This book is an attempt to explicate, illustrate, and critically examine the idea of polycontextual bridging between youth\u2019s leisure cultures and school material to enable students to learn in a new digital age. The authors do not present a common front on the complex question of the proper use of information and communication technology in the school but instead present a diversity of arguments and viewpoints.

He stays out of ghost-populated areas as much as possible these days, guiding wagon trains West from St. Louis, with his pragmatic and skeptical partner, Boz. During the spring work lull, Trace gets an unusual job offer. Miss Fairweather, a wealthy English bluestocking, needs someone to retrieve a dead friend's legacy from a nearby town, and she specifically wants Trace to do it. However, the errand proves to be far more sinister than advertised. When confronted, Miss Fairweather admits to knowing about Trace's curse, and suggests she might help him learn to control it--in exchange for a few more odd jobs. Trace has no interest in being her pet psychic, but he's been looking twenty years for a way to control his power, and Miss Fairweather's knowledge of the spirit world is too valuable to ignore. As she steers him into one macabre situation after another, his powers flourish, and Trace begins to realize some good might be done with this curse of his.

When Alexandrina Victoria was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 20 June 1837, she was 18 years old and barely five feet tall. Her subjects were fascinated and intrigued; some felt sorry for her. Writer Thomas Carlyle, watching her gilded coach draw away from the coronation, said: 'Poor little Queen, she is at an age at which a girl can hardly be trusted to choose a bonnet for herself; yet a task is laid upon her from which an archangel might shrink.' Queen Victoria is long dead, but in truth she has shaped us from the grave. She was a tiny, powerful woman who reigned for an astonishing 64 years. By the time of her Diamond Jubilee Procession in 1897, she reigned over a fourth of the inhabitable part of the world, had 400 million subjects, and had given birth to nine children. Suffrage, anti-poverty and anti-slavery movements can all be traced to her monumental reign, along with a profound rethinking of family life and the rise of religious doubt. When she died, in 1901, she was the longest reigning monarch in English history. Victoria is truly the woman who made the modern world.

Antiquarians and archaeologists early recognised the family resemblance of the different groups of tombs, attributing them to maritime peoples moving along the western seaways. More recent research sees them rather as the product of established early farming communities in their individual regions. Yet the diversity of the tombs, their chronologies and their varied cultural contexts complicates any straightforward understanding of their origins and distribution. Megalithic Architectures provides new insight by focusing on the construction and design of European megalithic tombs--on the tomb as an architectural project. It shows how much is to be learned from detailed attention to the stages and the techniques through which tombs were built, modified and enlarged, and often intentionally dismantled or decommissioned. The large slabs that were employed, often unshaped, may suggest an opportunistic approach by the Neolithic builders, but this was clearly far from the case. Each building project was unique, and detailed study of individual sites exposes the way in which tombs were built as architectural, social and symbolic undertakings. Alongside the manner in which the materials were used, it reveals a store of knowledge that sometimes differed considerably from one structure to another, even between contemporary monuments within a single region. The volume brings together regional specialists from Scandinavia, Germany, Britain, France, Belgium and Iberia to offer a series of uniquely authoritative studies.

This eagerly anticipated third and final volume of Reiner Stach's definitive biography answers that question with more facts, detail, and insight than ever before, describing the complex personal, political, and cultural circumstances that shaped the young Franz Kafka (1883-1924). It tells the story of the years from his birth in Prague to the beginning of his professional and literary career in 1910, taking the reader up to just before the breakthrough that resulted in his first masterpieces, including \"The Metamorphosis.\" Brimming with vivid and often startling details, Stach's narrative invites readers deep inside this neglected period of Kafka's life. The book's richly atmospheric portrait of his German Jewish merchant family and his education, psychological development, and sexual maturation draw on numerous sources, some still unpublished, including family letters, schoolmates' memoirs, and early diaries of his close friend Max Brod. The biography also provides a colorful panorama of Kafka's wider world, especially the convoluted politics and culture of Prague. Before World War I, Kafka lived in a society at the threshold of modernity but torn by conflict, and Stach provides poignant details of how the adolescent Kafka witnessed violent outbreaks of anti-Semitism and nationalism. The reader also learns how he developed a passionate interest in new technologies, particularly movies and airplanes, and why another interest--his predilection for the back-to-nature movement--stemmed from his \"nervous\" surroundings rather than personal eccentricity. The crowning touch to a masterly biography, this is an unmatched account of how a boy who grew up in an old Central European monarchy became a writer who helped create modern literature.\"--", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : Biography : English", "summary": "\r\n   \"How did Kafka become Kafka?

Besides offering a rich harvest of concrete case studies, Poetry and Poetics after Wallace Stevens also reconsiders possibilities for talking about poetic influence. How can we define and refine the ways in which we establish links between earlier and later poems? At what level of abstraction do such links exist? What have we learned from debates about competing poetic eras and traditions? How is our understanding of an older writer reshaped by engaging with later ones?

Where do automated vehicles fall under current legal frameworks? What risks are associated with automation and how will society respond to these risks? How will the marketplace react to automated vehicles and what changes may be necessary for companies? Experts from Germany and the United States define key societal, engineering, and mobility issues related to the automation of vehicles. They discuss the decisions programmers of automated vehicles must make to enable vehicles to perceive their environment, interact with other road users, and choose actions that may have ethical consequences. The authors further identify expectations and concerns that will form the basis for individual and societal acceptance of autonomous driving. While the safety benefits of such vehicles are tremendous, the authors demonstrate that these benefits will only be achieved if vehicles have an appropriate safety concept at the heart of their design. Realizing the potential of automated vehicles to reorganize traffic and transform mobility of people and goods requires similar care in the design of vehicles and networks. By covering all of these topics, the book aims to provide a current, comprehensive, and scientifically sound treatment of the emerging field of \"autonomous driving\".", "docType": "Book", "edition_format": "Print book : English", "summary": "\r\n   This book takes a look at fully automated, autonomous vehicles and discusses many open questions: How can autonomous vehicles be integrated into the current transportation system with diverse users and human drivers?

Queen Victoria is long dead, but in truth she has shaped us from the grave. She was a tiny, powerful woman who reigned for an astonishing 64 years. By the time of her Diamond Jubilee Procession in 1897, she reigned over a fourth of the inhabitable part of the world, had 400 million subjects, and had given birth to nine children. Suffrage, anti-poverty and anti-slavery movements can all be traced to her monumental reign, along with a profound rethinking of family life and the rise of religious doubt. When she died, in 1901, she was the longest reigning monarch in English history. Victoria is truly the woman who made the modern world.

Does their English betray the presence of another language, is that other language erased, or does it appear here and there, on special occasions for special reasons? Do words and meanings wander from one language and one self to another? Do the psychic and cultural worlds of different languages split apart or merge? What is the aesthetic effect of such wandering, splitting, or merging? Usually described as \"code-switches\" by linguists, fragments of other languages have wandered into American literature in English from the beginning. Wanderwords asks what, in the memoirs, poems, essays, and fiction of a variety of twentieth and twenty first century writers, the function and meaning of such language migration might be. It shows what there is to be gained if we learn to read migrant writing with an eye, and an ear, for linguistic difference and it concludes that, freighted with the other-cultural meanings wrapped up in their different looks and sounds, wanderwords can perform wonders of poetic signification as well as cultural critique. Bringing together literary and cultural theory with linguistics as well as the theory and history of migration, and with psychoanalysis for its understanding of the multilingual unconscious, Wanderwords engages closely with the work of well-known and unheard-of writers such as Mary Antin and Eva Hoffman, Richard Rodriguez and Junot Di;az, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha and Bharati Mukherjee, Edward Bok and Truus van Bruinessen, Susana Cha\u0301vez-Silverman and Gustavo Perez-Firmat, Pietro DiDonato and Don DeLillo.

In doing so, it enhances public and professional understanding of the complex issues and debates surrounding RE in the wider world. The volume emphasizes a student-centred approach, viewing any kind of 'RE', or its absence, as a formative lived experience for pupils. It stresses a bottom-up, sociological and ethnographic/anthropological research-based approach to the study of RE, rather than the 'top down' approaches which often start from prescriptive legal, ideological or religious standpoints. The twelve chapters in this volume regard RE as an entity that has multiple and contested meanings and interpretations that are constantly negotiated. For some, 'RE' means religious nurturing, either tailored to parental views or meant to inculcate a uniform religiosity. For others, RE means learning about the many religious and non-religious world-views and secular ethics that exist, not promoting one religion or another. Some seek to avoid the ambiguous term 'religious education', replacing it with terms such as 'education about religions and beliefs' or 'the religious dimension of intercultural education'.", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   This book examines Religious Education (RE) in over ten countries, including Australia, Indonesia, Mali, Russia, UK, Ireland, USA, and Canada.

It discusses educational aims in terms of rationality, philosophical thinking, and sustainable development and presents the literary, religious, and analytical approaches to moral education. Four educational policies are then considered: Hong Kong{u2019}s language policy, Hong Kong{u2019}s policy on the internationalization of education, East Asia{u2019}s policies on English education, and Australia{u2019}s policy on teacher education. Different aspects of the East-West dichotomy are analysed: Confucian rationalism versus Western rationalism, Confucian learning culture versus Western learning culture, and Asian research methodology versus Western research methodology.

{"genre_form": "Electronic books", "publisher": "Prahran : Hardie Grant, 2016.", "name": "Bucking the Trend", "author": "Chris Rogers", "abstract": "Most Australian Test players do things a certain way. Get into the Australian cricket pathway early. Go to the Academy. Win favour with senior players. Think about a cricket career from a young age. Think first of attack, and leave defence as a last resort. Treat the Baggy Green with reverence. Do things the Australian way, never mind the Poms. Keep the game as simple as possible. Avoid tinkering too much with technique.Chris 'Buck' Rogers did none of these things. Instead, he forged a cricket life in his own distinctive style, learning from mistakes and imparting that wisdom to others. In many ways he is a player out of time, harking back to the days when cricketers spent as much time with their clubs, states or counties as they did with the national side. Bucking the Trend is the story of a journeyman cricketer who, after one Test at the age of 30, took another five years to regain a spot in the Australian side. What followed was a rollercoaster ride, taking in emotional centuries in three Ashes series and skirting disaster with a series of blows to the head when they were feared more than ever. Rogers' road to the top was far from straightforward; there is rare richness in his cricketing tale.'Chris Rogers was relentless in his pursuit of runs and the opportunity to play at the highest level possible. His unbelievable perseverance was rewarded with an extended Test career long after most thought it was possible, and he brought every ounce of his skill and experience to the fore. Chris showed what hunger, adaptability and fierce determination can achieve. His story highlights these traits wonderfully.'Greg Dyer ACA President'Chris Rogers is a throwback. A craggy, no-frills batsman who makes runs unobtrusively but incessantly ... There is no machismo about his play. He forces the bowlers to work for his wicket.'Simon Hughes'He's a great man, he deserves all the accolades he gets, the way he's played since he's been part of the Australian team shows that age doesn't matter. If you are 19 or 37 and you're good enough, you are good enough.'Michael Clarke'There are so many admirable qualities that I love about Chris Rogers. He is tough, gritty, uncompromising and stoic, but never dour.'Dean JonesAbout the author: Chris Rogers retired from the Australian cricket team at the age of 37, at the top of his game - it's generally not how it happens. A left-handed opening batsman, he was first selected for the Australian Under 19 team in 1996. He represented Western Australia for 10 years and later Victoria. In 2007, with an average of 70.70, he was named State Player of the Year. During the mid-2000s he also established himself in English county cricket and over the years played for five first-class counties, most recently as skipper of Somerset. In 2008 Rogers made his Australian Test debut replacing the injured Matthew Hayden in a Test against India. But it was not until 2013, after consistent runmaking, that he was named in the national squad again following the retirement of Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey. Over his 25-match Test career Rogers' average was 42.87 with a highest score of 173.", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   Most Australian Test players do things a certain way.

Sutherland was inspired on this poetic path by Clara, an eighteenth-century rhinoceros she first encountered in porcelain form in an exhibit of ceramic animals at Toronto's Gardiner Museum. This chance experience set her off on a grand quest to learn all she could of Clara's story, and resulted in a collection that combines Robert Kroetschian documentary poetics with the meticulous research and environmental passion of Elizabeth Kolbert, to successfully examine the centuries-long path of the rhinoceros that's brought it to the brink of global extinction.

The false dichotomy is particularly important because solving the daunting challenges of the twenty-first century\u2014such as drug-resistant bacteria, scarcity of natural resources, and climate change\u2014requires global citizens armed with robust, complex abilities who can integrate interdisciplinary concepts with bold technologies.

As Imogen might say \"Google is good, but a cheat sheet is forever...\" In eight cheat sheets, Imogen takes you through the facts that come up in most conversations: the English language, math/economics, religion, history, politics, geography, biology and culture. From the history of money to who signed The Magna Carta, Imogen shows you how to get back in a conversation, win any argument and most importantly, how to pivot out of a tough conversational bind.

Inspired by the optimism of Independence, the project was designed in close consultation with the Ju'hoansi community in the early 1990s. Drawing upon their traditional knowledge transmission strategies, and initiated in a supportive political environment, the project exemplified 'best practice.' During the following two decades, the Village Schools have transitioned from a donor-supported 'project' to government schools, and have received much attention and support from donors, civil society organisations, researchers, and others. However, the students still do not seem to succeed in the mainstream schools. Why is this? Based on long-term field-work in the region, including interviews with Nyae Nyae residents over several years and work with involved organisations, the book addresses this question. Contextualising the Village Schools within post-Independence Namibia, southern African history and the global indigenous rights movement, it examines the enormous paradoxes that schooling presents for the Nyae Nyae community.

{"genre_form": "Electronic books", "publisher": "Heidelberg ; New York : Springer ; Beijing : China Electric Power Press, [2016]", "name": "Key project management based on effective project thinking", "author": "Ronggui Ding", "abstract": "This book provides an effective overall approach and concrete action strategies to help readers quickly grasp key aspects of project management and reduce the pressure during the learning process, so that they can soon start enjoying the fruits of successful project management. The problems discussed in this book have been drawn both from several years of theoretical research on the part of the author, and from communications between the author and hundreds of business executives and project managers from many domestic and international EMBA and CEO classes. The book's unique content is written in an easy-to-follow tone with typical Chinese systemic and dialectical thinking, intended to help readers find the appropriate way to solve problems as they encounter them. One of the popular misunderstandings about project management is to make project managers to take most of the responsibilities for project success, i.e. senior managers in companies usually think project management is not their business. This book puts project management in business context to eliminate this misunderstanding and demonstrates that: only if the senior managers recognize the value of projects and play their roles in project governance and project management right, their companies can survive and develop in the changing society. In order to solve the contradiction between the uniqueness of a project and the efficiency/reliability of its management, this book examines, based on Chinese dial ectical logic, the basic preparation needed for successful project management, including how to use unified principles to manage projects with different characteristics, how to create company-wide project governance infrastructure to make project managers to be able to take their management responsibilities, and how to establish effective relationships among project stakeholders to make unique projects to be manageable structured partner social networks, etc. This book explains how to deal with the key contradictions existing in each phase of a project, from project decision-making to close-out. This book is basically for both top managers of companies and project managers, so it addresses many challenges companies and project managers will have to face in the changing society, and provides essential strategies and methods for overcoming them.

Authors and scribes were raised in an intellectual and didactic tradition in which the acquisition and development of encyclopaedic knowledge was highly valued. Their concern with the elementary aspects of time, language, world history, God's creation and the Bible informed their activities as compilers of manuscripts or as producers of texts. They reaped the fruits of the learning that had grown over the centuries, digested them, or discarded them, or caused them to re-emerge after a long period of time and be used for purposes quite different from those for which they had originally been cultivated. The varieties of such fruit are as diverse as encyclopaedic learning itself, involving musicology, epistolography, liturgy, the study of grammar, codicology, the establishment of reading programmes, the writing of history and, perhaps most prominently, the compilation and promulgation of glosses and glossaries - one of the most essential disciplines in early medieval learning. The present volume casts light on the way in which encyclopaedic knowledge came to fruition in the ever expanding and diversifying world of medieval learning. Resulting from the fourth workshop in the 'Storehouses of Wholesome Learning' project, it builds on the foundations laid by its predecessors. The contributors discuss the influence of encyclopaedic knowledge in their respective fields of expertise.

For four years Monique W. Morris, author of Black Stats, chronicled the experiences of black girls across the country whose intricate lives are misunderstood, highly judged-by teachers, administrators, and the justice system-and degraded by the very institutions charged with helping them flourish.

Shadow shows itself here in myriad literary identities, revealing its force as a way of seeing and a form of knowing, as material for fable and parable. Taking up a vast range of texts--from the Bible, Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton to Poe, Dickinson, Eliot, and Stevens--Hollander describes how metaphors of shadow influence our ideas of dreaming, desire, doubt, and death. These shadows of poetry and prose fiction point to unknown, often fearful domains of human experience, showing us concealed shapes of truth and possibility. Crucially, Hollander explores how shadows in poetic history become things with a strange substance and life of their own: they acquire the power to console, haunt, stalk, wander, threaten, command, and destroy.

NVQs and approaches to competence in the UK: Contexts, issues and prospects. Peter Stokes, University of Chester, UK Abstract Competence frameworks are a long-standing part of the (United Kingdom) UK training and development environment (Chang et al. 2013; CIPD, 2007, 2013, 2014; Sparrow and Bognanno, 1994). In the British context, competence-based approaches and qualifications evoke strong reactions both in terms of supporters and detractors regarding their worth, viability and relevance. Nevertheless, they have been repeatedly employed by governments and employers\u2019 bodies as a means of responding to skills gaps in business sectors and the national economy. The Chapter examines these tensions and surfaces the underlying paradigms and drivers contributing a novel insight into competence in the UK context. The Chapter identifies prevalent characteristics in the UK competence domain. It explains these features through the impact of hegemonic modernistic and positivistic paradigms built on British socio-political traditions of empiricism, pragmatism and the valuing of the experiential. These, in turn, dominate large areas of management, organization thinking and competence approaches operating in connection with processes of commodification, marketization and socio-political issues. This context is illustrated with an ethnographically-styled case study on the implementation of a competence framework in a British semi-skilled employee organizational setting. Overall, the Chapter, in identifying and contextualising the paradigms which operate at the heart of competence in the UK, reveals implications linked to individual meaning, social class and professional identity and, also, potential future trajectories of competence in an increasingly complex world.", "docType": "Internet Resource", "edition_format": "eBook : English", "summary": "\r\n   Chapter 15.

While widely regarded as effective, unanswered questions exist about what elements of the clinical context must be recreated in simulated settings to promote authenticity. Moreover, the degree of authenticity (or fidelity) required for optimal learning is not known, with current thinking often deemphasizing the importance of physical realism. We therefore sought to explore contextual influences on performance in a \u2018context-rich\u2019 clinical setting: paramedicine. Methods We followed constructivist grounded theory principles and recruited currently practicing paramedics to participate in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews. We asked the participants to describe a recent experience in which they attempted to resuscitate a victim of sudden cardiac arrest and asked them how to recreate their experiences in simulated settings. Results Fourteen paramedics provided a total of seventeen interviews, each describing a distinct cardiac arrest event, yielding over ten hours of audio data for analysis. We iteratively identified three major interrelated themes describing contextual influences: the event \u2013 its physical characteristics, circumstances and people present; the conceptual response \u2013 the cognitive processes and challenges encountered; and the emotional response \u2013 the degree of emotional engagement in the management of the resuscitation. We also identified a major theme related to how to simulate these events. Collectively, our results suggest a complex and dynamic interplay between the physical, conceptual and emotional domains of context. Conclusion In contrast to other conceptualizations of context and fidelity, our results suggest that conceptual and emotional responses occur as a result of physical features in the practice environment, arguing in favour of physical authenticity in simulation.", "docType": "Internet Resource", "edition_format": "eBook : English", "summary": "\r\n   Introduction Simulation-based learning is an example of learning in context in which clinical contexts are recreated in controlled settings to facilitate deliberate practice.

Our primary research objective was to investigate whether using gamification design approaches to mobile educational software could result in student engagement and learning. Our central hypothesis is that gamification design approaches can be used to create engaging and educationally effective mobile educational software. Our secondary research objective is to determine how mobile educational software can be made more or less engaging and educationally effective through gamification design approaches, by trying different approaches, testing the resulting applications, and reporting the findings. Three studies were conducted based on these objectives, one study to teach various computer science concepts to students in a first year computer science course with iPad applications, and two studies which used iPad applications to teach punctuation and homonyms, and improve reading comprehension. The studies document the design of the applications, and provide analysis and conclusions based on the results of testing. Through the results of these studies we affirm our hypothesis. We make design suggestions for software creators, such as providing corrective feedback to the user.

Based on existing rodent studies, we hypothesize that exercise will cause a shift to allocentric processing, away from a less robust egocentric learning strategy. It is possible that exercise-induced relief of chronic stress, which contributes to improved hippocampal function, will increase reliance on allocentric spatial navigation. Neurogenesis, which occurs in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus, is another indicator of hippocampal function that may influence this shift to allocentric learning. The current study examines whether six weeks of aerobic exercise enhances allocentric processing in healthy young adults. Forty-nine young adults (35 female; age range 18-29 years) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) High intensity interval training group, 2) Moderate intensity training group, or 3) Non-exercising control group. Hippocampus-dependent memory was assessed before and after the intervention on a Virtual Reality Water Maze task, and a high interference memory task, the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) which may be dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis. Levels of chronic stress and depression were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II. It was expected that exercise would improve spatial memory performance on the water maze task, and that performance would improve in proportion to enhanced fitness levels. This improvement in spatial memory performance was expected to correlate with the two indicators of hippocampal function that were assessed in the current study\u2014chronic stress and performance on the high interference memory task.

They found a desirable difficulty effect when directing a conflict towards the categorization stage through classifying names by gender. However, no such effect was seen when classifying words by size. They provided evidence that gender classification is more semantically central than categorizing items by size, which tends to be relative and depend on context. We took the same stimuli used in the Thomson et al. (in prep) but had participants make animacy judgments (animal or \u201cthing\u201d) on words. A subsequent memory test revealed a desirable difficulty effect for incongruent words compared to congruent. Interestingly, animal words were better remembered overall compared to \u201cthing\u201d words. A second experiment directed a conflict towards the categorization and response processing stages through classifying names as male and female with semantic (male/female) and response selection (left/right) primes. A subsequent memory test revealed a desirable difficulty pattern of results (although non-significant) where incongruent compared to congruent words were better remembered for the sematic primes and congruent compared to incongruent words were better remembered for response primes.

For this study, essays written by community college freshman students in the second half of the fall 2014 semester in courses using both delivery modes were assessed by three independent raters, using a rubric. The two one-sided t test (TOST) method was used to determine equivalence and ascertain whether the students' scores fell within a zone of equivalence of \u00b130% of the mean for the scores.  Because the face-to-face students had consistently higher means, t tests were then used to determine whether these differences were significant. The findings of this study revealed that the face-to-face and distance learning freshman composition courses were not equivalent for any of the rubric outcome areas of essay structure, essay content, essay clarity, and use of sources.  The findings also indicated that for most of the outcome areas, the means were significantly different, with the face-to-face students out-performing the distance-learning students in all of the rubric outcome areas.", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File, Archival Material", "edition_format": "eBook : Manuscript ", "summary": "\r\n   Distance learning has become an increasingly important element in the landscape of higher education, with more colleges and universities considering distance learning course delivery as part of their strategic plans.

The day war is declared, Mary North leaves finishing school unfinished, goes straight to the War Office, and signs up. Tom Shaw decides to ignore the war?until he learns his roommate Alistair Heath has unexpectedly enlisted. Then the conflict can no longer be avoided. Young, bright, and brave, Mary is certain she?d be a marvelous spy. When she is?bewilderingly?made a teacher, she finds herself defying prejudice to protect the children her country would rather forget. Tom, meanwhile, finds that he will do anything for Mary.

{"genre_form": "Electronic books", "publisher": "London : Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2016.", "name": "Multilingual Literacies, Identities and Ideologies : Exploring Chain Migration from Pakistan to the UK.", "author": "Tony Capstick", "abstract": "This book explores the language and literacy practices which sustain transnational migration across generations and across traditional boundaries such as school and home. The author has conducted extensive fieldwork in Pakistan and the UK to study migration between the two countries. Individuals' access to the dominant literacies of migration are contrasted with the vernacular practices which migrants take up at home as part of their digital literacies. The study explores the blurring of boundaries between home and school as well as the blurring of boundaries between language varieties. Tracing access to literacy in this way also shines a light on the literacy mediators migrants turn to for help with English language learning and when trying to access the bureaucratic literacies of migration.

An Exploration of Mind Wandering During Classroom-Based Teaching Sessions (Academic Half-Days) in Postgraduate Medical Education", "author": "Anita Acai", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Academic half-days (AHDs) are regular teaching events that occur outside of patient care.

This thesis examines mind wandering during academic half-days (AHDs) in postgraduate medical training through two studies, with the overarching goal of understanding how results might inform the design of classroom-based teaching sessions in postgraduate medical education. METHODS: In the first study, a qualitative approach was used to examine residents\u2019 perceptions about the nature of their learning experience during AHDs. Two focus groups were held with residents in hematology (n = 5) and obstetrics and gynecology (n = 15) and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. In the second study, thought probes were administered approximately every 15 minutes during three AHD sessions in each program (hematology: n = 6 residents; obstetrics and gynecology: n = 30 residents) to quantitatively examine how three commonly-used instructional methods (didactic lecture, group discussion, and case-based learning) influenced mind wandering during AHDs. RESULTS: Findings of the qualitative study revealed differences with respect to residents\u2019 overall perceptions of AHDs, perceptions of attention during AHDs, and motivations for learning. However, residents in both programs agreed that presenters could maximize resident engagement and learning by spending more time on case-based learning and group discussions as opposed to didactic lectures.

Brownfields do not have an unexplored soil system, it is already used in many ways. Therefore \u2018Urban design with the subsurface\u2019 should be considered a new frontier in urban planning and design. The neglect of the subsurface in spatial planning is due to the fact that responsibilities, tools and knowledge of subsurface engineering and urban planning and design are not integrated, they work on the same locations but divided into sectors.

As such, this important and timely book joins the small but growing collection of works offering an overdue assessment of the French contribution to the Great War. Drawing heavily on French primary sources the book has two main foci: it is both an in-depth battle narrative and analysis, as well as a work on the tactical evolution of the French army in Spring 1915 as it endeavored aggressively to come to grips with trench warfare. This period is of crucial importance as it was in these months that the French army learned the foundations of trench warfare on which their conduct for the remainder of the war would rest. The work argues that many advanced practices often considered German innovations - such as the rolling barrage, infiltration tactics, and the effective planning and integration of artillery bombardments - can all be traced back to French writing and action in early 1915. The work argues that - contrary to received opinion - French army bureaucracy proved effective at very quickly taking in, digesting and then disseminating lessons learned at the front and French commanders proved to be both effective and professional.

It begins by considering the broader national context, including the increasing participation of students with disability in higher education, and recent developments in employment law, education standards, and professional registration requirements. The origins of inherent requirement statements are examined with reference to key milestones associated with Curtin University, the University of Melbourne and Western Sydney University, and relevant literature is explored to situate university activities in relation to historical policy, legislative, and research trends. International literature is also examined to reveal the significant influence of overseas policies, particularly in the United States.

Consequently, Dutch and Spanish lie at opposite ends of the rhythm continuum.

When comparing accentual and final lengthening data by L2 learners with a low (A2) and high (B2) proficiency level in both learning directions, it is therefore expected that the DLS will advance more towards their respective target native speaker control group than SLD.

Alzheimer\u2019s disease presents as global cognitive decline with associated memory loss and altered personality. The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease include extracellular beta-amyloid-containing plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyper-phosphorylated tau protein. There is increasing evidence that although the primary insult in Alzheimer\u2019s disease may be over-expression of amyloid-\u03b2, it may ultimately lead to cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration by inducing alterations in tau. While the precise toxic mechanism of these accumulated proteins is not well understood, our hypothesis is that both amyloid-\u03b2 and tau exert their neurotoxicity via down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is crucial for synaptic function, neuronal survival and learning and memory and is decreased in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, tauopathies and in several relevant animal and cellular models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Using differentiated, human neuroblastoma cells, we found that treatment with oligomeric A\u03b2 down-regulates basal levels of BDNF as a consequence of A\u03b2-induced CREB transcriptional down-regulation. Similarly, these cells, when made to over-express wild-type tau, also exhibit reduced BDNF expression. They specifically lose the major CREB-regulated BDNF transcript, transcript IV. Using transgenic mice, we showed that neither tau mutations nor neurofibrillary tangles are required for BDNF reduction, but that wild-type tau over-expression is sufficient to down-regulate BDNF. Lastly, we crossed APP23 mice, which over-express A\u03b2 and exhibit reduced BDNF, with Tau knockout (TauKO) mice. BDNF levels were partially rescued in the APP23xTauKO animals, indicating that tau is an intermediate in A\u03b2-induced BDNF down-regulation. These results demonstrate that both soluble A\u03b2 and tau down-regulate BDNF, which likely co", "docType": "Internet Resource", "edition_format": "eBook : English", "summary": "\r\n   Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly.

The work presented in this dissertation conceptualizes CID as a pathophysiologically distinct form of depression. To investigate CID at the most basic level, we first developed a preclinical model that was validated by comparison to an established model of stress-induced depressive-like behaviours. The positive control model was developed by chronically treating female BALB/c mice with oral corticosterone (CORT). The CID model was developed using subcutaneous inoculation with 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells. Anhedonia, behavioural despair, and dendritic atrophy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were observed in both models. Similar to many human cancer cell lines, 4T1 cells were shown to secrete significant amounts of glutamate, which was markedly attenuated using the system xc- inhibitor sulfasalazine (SSZ). In CID mice, oral treatment with SSZ was at least as effective as fluoxetine, a popular clinical antidepressant, at preventing depressive-like behaviours. This effect was primarily attributable to intact SSZ, rather than its anti-inflammatory metabolite. RNA-sequencing was performed on hippocampal samples from CID and CORT animals. Analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) revealed significant overlap between the two models. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and biological process gene ontologies (GO:BP) terms related to ion homeostasis and neuronal communication were enriched for both models. CID was associated with additional DEGs that were not identified in the CORT model. These DEGs were enriched in KEGG pathways and GO:BP terms related to neuronal development, intracellular signalling cascade, learning, and memory.

In The Light Between Us, she shares her remarkable journey and the lessons in love she's learned along the way. Jackson is just a child when she first realizes she is different from her peers.

She has premonitions about friends and family members that leave her feeling helpless, sad, and confused. She confides in her mother-and learns that the gift runs in the family.

At night, in private, she conducts readings that connect people with loved ones who have passed and imparts information with shocking accuracy and insight.

Blum concludes that the dominant forms of higher education do not match the myriad forms of learning that help students--people in general--master meaningful and worthwhile skills and knowledge. Students are capable of learning huge amounts, but the ways higher education is structured often leads them to fail to learn. More than that, it leads to ill effects. In this critique of higher education, infused with anthropological insights, Blum explains why so much is going wrong and offers suggestions for how to bring classroom learning more in line with appropriate forms of engagement.

HF outcomes can be improved by self-care behaviors, to which patients often show low adherence. This study focuses on the co-design of an online self-care application and community intervention, called HFApp, which patients with HF and their informal caregivers could use to potentially improve HF outcomes. The intended users for HFApp are older adults with HF and their informal caregivers. The primary objective of this study is to identify themes for the development of HFApp. The secondary objective is to apply these findings to identify user needs and preferences for HFApp. Persona-scenario discussion sessions were conducted with 4 older patients with HF (\u2265 60 years) and 4 informal caregivers from the Hamilton Health Sciences Heart Function Clinic. One persona-scenario discussion session was held for each participant type (i.e. patients with HF or informal caregivers). Participants were divided into pairs and participant pairs created personas and scenarios together. Scenarios included: (1) how they learn about HFApp, (2) how they might access HFApp, (3) where they are when they use HFApp, (4) who might help them with HFApp, and (5) how often they use HFApp. All discussions were audio recorded. Data analysis, using NVivo 10 , provided six categories of design themes which were used to develop a list of user requirements for HFApp. Some of these requirements help users perceive HFApp to be more useful and give a sense of self-care confidence. However, some requirements may be excluded due to low feasibility.

The volume covers topics from early to late language development, its interaction with literacy practices, including several languages, monolingual and multilingual contexts, different scripts, as well as typical and atypical development. Inspired by the work of Liliana Tolchinsky, a leading expert in language and literacy development, a group of internationally renowned scholars offers a state-of-the-art overview of current thinking in language development in literate societies in its broadest sense. This book is a fitting tribute to Liliana Tolchinsky, one of the premier researchers in writing and language development. It delivers on the promise in the title to examine developmental relationships between oral and written language. Compared to the extensive research on relationships between reading and writing, there is relatively little work connecting speaking and writing. Comparisons between oral and written language demand detailed investigation of linguistic features, including semantics, morphology, syntax, and pragmatics, all of which are addressed. As primarily a cognitive researcher, I am aware that we do not pay adequate attention to linguistic factors in studying writing development and instruction. Several of the chapters provided insights that I will use in my own work. I anticipate that the book will be enthusiastically received by researchers with interests in writing development, linguistics, relationships between speech and writing, and writing assessment.

Beginning in the seventeenth century and moving up through the present day, Theophano reads between the lines of recipes for dandelion wine, \"Queen of Puddings,\" and half-pound cake to capture the stories and voices of these remarkable women.The selection of books looked at is enticing and wide-ranging. Theophano begins with seventeenth-century English estate housekeeping books that served as both cookbooks and reading primers so that women could educate themselves during long hours in the kitchen. She looks at A Date with a Dish, a classic African American cookbook that reveals the roots of many traditional American dishes, and she brings to life a 1950s cookbook written specifically for Americans by a Chinese EmigrE and transcribed into English by her daughter. Finally, Theophano looks at the contemporary cookbooks of Lynne Rosetto Kaspar, Madeleine Kamman, and Alice Waters to illustrate the sophistication and political activism present in modern cookbook writing. Janet Theophano harvests the rich history of cookbook writing to show how much more can be learned from a recipe than how to make a casserole, roast a chicken, or bake a cake.

Born a prince in the medieval Korean state of Kory{breve}o (960-1279), he traveled to Song China (960-1279) to study Buddhism and later compiled and published the first collection of East Asian exegetical texts. According to the received scholarly tradition, after returning to Korea, {breve}Uich'{breve}on left the Hwa{breve}om (Huayan) school to found a new Ch'{breve}ont'ae (Tiantai) school when he realized that the synthesis between doctrinal learning and meditative practice in the latter would help bring together the discordant sects of Kory{breve}o Buddhism. In the late twentieth century, however, scholars began to question the assertion that {breve}Uich'{breve}on forsook one school for another, arguing that his writings assembled in The Collected Works of State Preceptor Taegak (Taegak kuksa munjip) do not portray a committed sectarian but a monk dedicated to developing a sophisticated and rigorous system of monastic education that encompassed all Buddhist intellectual traditions. In this first comprehensive study of {breve}Uich'{breve}on's life and work in English, Richard McBride presents translations of select lectures, letters, essays, and poetry from The Collected Works to provide a more balanced view of {breve}Uich'{breve}on's philosophy of life and understanding of key Buddhist teachings. The translations center on the monk's activities in the pan-East Asian Buddhist world and his compilation of scholarly texts, writings related to his interactions with royalty, and correspondence with his Chinese mentor, Jinshui Jingyuan (1011-1088). By incorporating {breve}Uich'{breve}on's work associated with doctrinal Buddhism and his poetry, McBride clearly shows that even in his most personal work {breve}Uich'{breve}on did not abandon Hwa{breve}om teachings for those of the Ch'{breve}ont'ae but rather he encouraged monks to blend the best learning from all doctrinal traditions with meditative practice.", "docType": "Internet Resource, Computer File", "edition_format": "eBook : Document : English", "summary": "\r\n   {Breve}Uich'{breve}on (1055-1101) is recognized as a Buddhist master of great stature in the East Asian tradition.

However, these ideas are incorrect and are not supported by current research. In the classroom, childrena\u0302s trauma symptoms may be understood as attentional deficits, learning disabilities, or behavioural or conduct problems (Downey, 2007). Researchers like Teicher et al. (2003) argue that trauma-informed behaviours are important coping mechanisms that a child may develop to survive extremely stressful experiences, and that focusing on eliminating these behaviours may be damaging to a child, especially in the context of ongoing trauma. Therefore, it is important for educators working with traumatised children to understand the key developmental pathways that may be affected by childhood trauma, and to understand how to support resilience through these pathways (Perkins & Graham-Bermann, 2012). This paper provides a brief synthesis of relevant research from neuroscience, psychology and education to highlight new understandings in childhood trauma research. Rather than being an exhaustive review, it aims to highlight relevant research when considering childhood trauma, and to support reflection on current practice and policy when considering traumatised children in schools.

This combination enables him to trace genealogies, offer comparative commentary and it facilitates a deep understanding of the ideological consequences of themes, myths, language, dramaturgy and theatrical strategies. Focusing on leading Scottish playwrights including David Greig, Liz Lochhead, John McGrath, Robert McLellan and Rona Munro, Brown explores how they have created plays that draw attention to competing versions of history, marginalised histories and the potential to revision history as a way of engaging in debates around such themes as power, independence, gender and the past and future of the Scottish nation.\" - Nadine Holdsworth, Professor of Theatre and Performance, Warwick University, UK \"Ian Brown has written an excellent book about the infinite adaptability of history.

These cells are regulated by orchestrated signalling within their local environment. Aberrant aspects of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, or integration have been linked to various neurological diseases including Fragile X syndrome (FXS)\u2014a disorder characterized by intellectual and social changes due to the silencing of the gene encoding FMRP. The biology of hippocampal NPCs in FXS during early postnatal development has not been studied, despite high FMRP expression levels in the hippocampus at the end of the first postnatal week. In this thesis, the Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse model was used to study hippocampal cell biology during early postnatal development. A tissue culture assay, used to study the effect of astrocyte-secreted factors on the proliferation of NSCs, indicated that astrocyte secreted factors from Fmr1-KO brains enhanced the proliferation of wild type, but not Fmr1-KO NSCs (Chapter 3). Next, the proliferation and cell cycle profiles of NPCs in vitro and in vivo studied with immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and flow cytometry revealed decreased proliferation of NPCs in the Fmr1-KO hippocampus (Chapter 4). Finally, cells isolated from the P7 dentate gyrus and characterized by flow cytometry, showed a reduced proportion of NSCs and an increased proportion of neuroblasts\u2014neuronal committed progenitors\u2014in Fmr1-KO mice. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal NPCs show aberrant proliferation and neurogenesis during early postnatal development. This could indicate stem-cell depletion, increased quiescence, or a developmental delay in relation to lack of FMRP and uncovers a new role for FMRP in the early postnatal hippocampus. In turn, elucidating the mechanisms that underlie FXS will aid in the development of targeted treatments.", "docType": "Internet Resource", "edition_format": "eBook : English", "summary": "\r\n   The regulation of neural precursor cells (NPCs), which encompass neural progenitor and neural stem cells (NSCs), is fundamental for proper brain development and function.

It addresses the need to investigate how humanities discussions, often exclusively drawn from, and grounded in, western contexts, are today being played out in these three places. The humanities in contemporary Chinese contexts may have different social and pedagogical roles, and a consideration of them will enable people to moderate, and perhaps even refute, claims made in the recent (re)readings of the humanities. As Asian universities rise in the global rankings and as east-west university collaborations and partnerships become more common, it is important that the nature, practice and institutionalization of the humanities in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China are explored and described for English readers. Exploring new perspectives arising from an examination of the humanities in these places, this volume aims neither to establish a position of polarity, which would pit western sites against Chinese ones, nor to argue for universal sameness. Rather, the goal is to find nuanced correspondences and differences between these various backgrounds, so that there is a greater understanding of the specificities of Chinese contexts. This will help shed light not only on the contexts in question, but also potentially on how to rearticulate the importance of the humanities in general, creating an intercultural dialogue focused on the humanities.

Ecosystems are self-organizing systems, made of communities connected in networks of mass, energy, and information exchanges; thinking of a project as a complex network of agents -- such as stakeholders, teams, providers, and customers -- illustrates the analogy between ecosystems and social, organized systems such as projects or programs. Ecosystem dynamics studies the complex relationships among the system's entities with particular reference to the ability of the ecosystems to withstand external shocks -- such as increasing level of pollutants or climate change -- while maintaining their functionality. This peculiar feature is usually referred to as system resilience. Resilience is enhanced by a number of factors including ecosystem variety, existence of redundant mechanisms of control, and a low level of connectedness among ecosystem entities. Ways of building resilience in projects, programs, and portfolios include establishing redundancies within project teams, cultivating responsible and ethical team leadership, building modular project architectures, and channeling signals across portfolio components to the highest decisional level.", "docType": "Book, Computer File", "edition_format": "Print book : Document : Conference publication ", "summary": "\r\n   Managing complexity and turbulence is a key issue project managers have to face in their everyday activity: dealing with change and external shocks is becoming the rule.

This account was achieved through an audit of the curriculum materials from 11 ASEAN countries, comprising those countries already participating in the SEA-PLM field trial, and others likely to join SEAPLM in the future. The audit examined statements concerning the overarching orientation of education in each country and then focused on the details of the curriculum for Grade 5, as the first set of assessment instruments developed for SEA-PLM target this grade level. This document presents the outcomes of the curriculum audit in the domains of Reading, Writing, Mathematics, and Global Citizenship for the following countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor Leste and Vietnam.

Book production and consumption increased dramatically, and practices such as letter- and diary-writing were widespread. This study demonstrates the importance of the nineteenth century in French cultural change and illustrates the changing priorities and concerns of l'histoire du livre since the 1970s. From the 1830s on, book production experienced an industrial revolution which led to the emergence of a mass literary culture by the close of the century. At the same time, the western world acquired mass literacy. New categories of readers became part of the reading public while western society also learned to write. Reading Culture and Writing Practices in Nineteenth-Century France examines how the concerns of historians have shifted from a search for statistical sources to more qualitative assessments of readers' responses. Martyn Lyons argues that autobiographical sources are vitally important to this investigation and he considers examples of the intimate and everyday writings of ordinary people.

Korean Through Folktales is designed to accompany 1st-year, 2nd-year, and 3rd-year Korean courses offered at Portland State University. However, any Korean teacher can adopt this book to supplement his/her course materials at elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels. There are four chapters in the book. Each chapter will note main themes of a widely known folktale introduced in the chapter, followed by the links to several videos to watch and get a gist or a background of the story. The ensuing section will introduce important elements and symbolism embedded in the story so as to provide insights and to enhance the depth of appreciation. After that, three versions of the folktale are presented for different levels, followed by grammar lessons, exercises, and tasks. Traces of folktales and allusions to them are evident in cultural products that many students enjoy, such as dramas, movies, and music.
